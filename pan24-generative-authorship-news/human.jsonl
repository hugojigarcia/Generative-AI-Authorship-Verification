Then, taking his place in the White House Oval Office, he plunged into a stack of executive actions that began to undo the heart of his polarizing predecessor 's agenda on matters from the deadly pandemic to climate change.\n\nAt the Capitol, with America's tradition of peaceful transfers of power never appearing more fragile, the ceremony unfolded within a circle of security forces evocative of a war zone and devoid of crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInstead, Biden gazed out on a cold Washington morning dotted with snow flurries to see over 200,000 American flags planted on the National Mall to symbolize those who could not attend in person.\n\n\"The will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious and democracy is fragile. At this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,\" Biden declared in his speech. \"This is America's day.

The former U.S. senator from California is also the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency and the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in the U.S. government.\n\nBiden never mentioned his predecessor, who defied tradition and left town ahead of the ceremony, but his speech was an implicit rebuke of Donald Trump. The new president denounced \"lies told for power and for profit\" and was blunt about the challenges ahead.\n\nCentral among them: the surging virus that has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the United States, as well as economic strains and a national reckoning over race.\n\n\"We have much to do in this winter of peril, and significant possibilities. Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build and much to gain,\" Biden said. \"Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged, or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now.\"\n\nBiden was eager to go big early, with an ambitious first 100 days including a push to speed up the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations to anxious Americans and pass a $1.9 trillion economic relief package. It included a blitz of executive orders on matters that don't require congressional approval — a mix of substantive and symbolic steps to unwind the Trump years. His actions included re-entry into the Paris Climate Accords and a mandate for wearing masks on federal property.\n\n\"There's no time to start like today,\" a masked Biden said. in the Oval Office. Then he swore in hundreds of aides — virtually — telling them, \"You're my possibilities.\"\n\nThe absence of Biden's predecessor from the inaugural ceremony underscored the national rift to be healed.\n\nBut a bipartisan trio of former presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama — were there to witness the transfer of power. Trump, awaiting his second impeachment trial, was at his Florida resort by the time the swearing-in took place."}

But the heavily fortified backdrop against which he'll take his oath of office will be a stark and surreal reminder of the challenges he'll face as he tries to make good on that promise of healing the deeply divided country.\n\nStill reeling from the Capitol attack Donald Trump set in motion January 6, Washington has been bracing for the potential for more MAGA violence, with a massive, multi-pronged security effort underway to protect the peaceful transfer of power—a hallmark of American democracy that has come under threat, thanks to Trump's refusal, to the bitter end, to acknowledge his election loss. True to form, Trump won't be attending his successor's inauguration—not that anyone really wants to see him glowering behind Biden the whole ceremony anyway—but there is significant concern that some of his ardent supporters might try.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the FBI on Monday tipped off law enforcement agencies to the threat of QAnon cultists descending on D.C. for the inauguration, possibly disguised as National Guard troops. \"QAnon members have discussed posing as National Guard soldiers, believing that it would be easy for them to infiltrate secure areas,\" the bureau said in an intelligence report, the Post reported. Devotees to the deranged conspiracy theory, which holds that Trump has been waging a secret war on a Democratic cabal of cannibal sex traffickers, were among the crowd of MAGA extremists who stormed the Capitol earlier this month as lawmakers formalized Biden's victory. While the FBI did not identify any specific plots against the inauguration on the scale of that siege, it is warning that Q adherents have been scheming up ways to disrupt Wednesday's ceremony, including by exploiting vulnerabilities in the capital city's security blanket and by blending in with the more than 20,000 troops that have been mobilized. The bureau is also warning of \"lone wolf\" threats to the ceremony.\n\n\"We're monitoring all incoming leads, whether they're calls for armed protest, potential threats that grow out of the January 6 breach of the Capitol, or other kinds of potential threats leading up to inaugural events and in various other targets,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said last week.\n\nThe threats of further violence has already made for a tense transition of power. But the possibility of insurrectionists posing as security forces could make the effort to protect the event even more complicated—especially amid ongoing concerns about extremists within law enforcement and the military. The radicals who converged on Capitol Hill January 6 included several people with a history of service, including Ashli Babbitt, who was killed in the riot and has become something of a martyr to the pro-Trump right. The Associated Press reported Tuesday that two Army National Guard members \"are being removed from the security mission\" at the inauguration because they are said to \"have been found to have ties to fringe right group militias.\""}

Included in the catalogue—along with notable moments like her 2010 \"meat dress\" and her first Academy Award win in 2019 in Brandon Maxwell and Tiffany's yellow diamond—is the custom Schiaparelli Haute Couture design she wore to perform at President Joe Biden's inauguration this past January. \"This is one of my favorite things I've ever worn,\" Gaga says, before revealing that the dress was actually bulletproof.\n\nAnd choosing Schiaparelli, an Italian designer, was a deeply personal choice for the multihyphenate star: \"When I saw that golden dove, I just knew that this was the right piece, and I knew, Schiaparelli being an Italian fashion house, it was something that I really, really wanted to do for my heritage as an Italian-American woman that would be singing for President 45 to be leaving and to invite President 46 into office,\" she says in the video. Below, our original story from January 2021 on Gaga's custom Schiaparelli creation.\n\nLady Gaga is never one to shy away from a major fashion moment. Yesterday, when she arrived at the Capitol for the inauguration dress rehearsal, she wore a simple and elegant white cape (via Givenchy by Matthew Williams) with a pretty plait crowning her head. Many fans were quick to note the Princess Leia vibes (see: Carrie Fisher in 1977's Star Wars: Episode IV).\n\nThis morning, as she stepped out onto the platform to sing the national anthem for the inauguration ceremony of 46th President Joe Biden, Gaga's look was decidedly more theatrical. The star opted for a custom Schiaparelli haute couture design—a fitted navy cashmere jacket that gave way to a voluminous washed red silk faille skirt. Her hair was in the same braid as the day before, but with a red flower tucked into the back. The crowning glory of the outfit, though, was undoubtedly the giant gilded brooch in the shape of a dove, which, as we all know, is a symbol of peace."}

Armored vehicles and concrete barriers blocked empty streets. Miles of fencing cordoned off many of the nation's most familiar landmarks.\n\nJoe Biden was safely sworn in as president in a Washington on edge, two weeks after rioters loyal to former President Donald Trump besieged the Capitol.\n\nLaw enforcement officials contended not only with the potential for outside threats but also with rising concerns about an insider attack. Officials monitored members of far-right extremist and militia groups, increasingly concerned about the risk they could stream into Washington and spark violent confrontations, a law enforcement official said.\n\nThere were a few scattered arrests but no major protests or serious disruptions in the city during Biden's inauguration ceremony.\n\nAs Biden put it in his address: \"Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever.\"\n\nAfter the deadly attack that killed five on Jan. 6, the Secret Service stepped up security for the inauguration early, essentially locking down the nation's capital. More than 25,000 troops and police were called to duty. The National Mall was closed. Checkpoints were set up at intersections.\n\nIn the hours before the event, federal agents monitored \"concerning online chatter,\" which included an array of threats against elected officials and discussions about ways to infiltrate the inauguration, the official said.\n\nIn right-wing online chat groups, believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory expressed disappointment that top Democrats were not arrested for sex trafficking and that Trump did not seize a second term.\n\nTwelve National Guard members were removed from the security operation a day earlier after vetting by the FBI, including two who had made extremist statements in posts or texts about Wednesday's event. Pentagon officials would not give details on the statements. The FBI vetted all 25,000 members in an extraordinary security effort in part over the presence of some ex-military in the riot.\n\nTwo other U.S. officials told The Associated Press that all 12 were found to have ties with right-wing militia groups or to have posted extremist views online. The officials, a senior intelligence official and an Army official briefed on the matter, did not say which fringe groups the Guard members belonged to or what unit they served in. The officials told the AP they had all been removed because of \"security liabilities.\"\n\nThe officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, confirmed that Guard members had been removed and sent home, but said only two cases were related to inappropriate comments or texts related to the inauguration. He said the other 10 cases were for issues that may involve previous criminal behavior or activities but were not directly related to the inaugural event.\n\nThe FBI also warned law enforcement officials about the possibility that members of right-wing fringe groups could pose as National Guard troops, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the matter.\n\nInvestigators in Washington were particularly worried that members of right-wing extremist groups and militias, like the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, would descend on Washington to spark violence, the law enforcement officials said. Some of the groups are known to recruit former military personnel, to train extensively and to have frequented anti-government and political protests."}

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris's was awash in the color purple. From Dr. Jill Biden's head-to-toe violet ensemble by Jonathan Cohen Studio the night before to the brilliant shade of Harris's jewel-toned coat and dress to the rich plum tone of former First Lady Michelle Obama's swaggering jacket, turtleneck and wide-leg trousers cinched with a demonstrative gold buckle belt for the ceremony itself.\n\nFormer Senator, Secretary of State, presidential candidate and First Lady Hillary Clinton wore a vivid purple Ralph Lauren pantsuit and matching scarf under a deep maroon coat, a nod to the Ralph Lauren pantsuit she wore to deliver her concession speech in 2016. Former First Lady Laura Bush's ladified jacket danced on the line between lilac and powder blue, and Senator Amy Klobuchar channeled the hue with her scarf. Even outgoing Vice President Mike Pence's tie, typically ruby red, appeared to be plucked from the burgundy region of Pantone's purple family.\n\nThe color purple is rich with symbolism. It's the color of royalty, and as Gwendolyn Dubois Shaw, senior historian of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, points out, \"Our democracy came out of a monarchy and colonial situation. We've never had our own royalty so we tend to project that desire.\"\n\nIt's the color of the Purple Heart, the badge of honor and bravery bestowed by the United States military on veterans wounded or killed in the line of duty. It's the title of Alice Walker's 1982 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the plight of African American women in the South, a parallel with meaning not lost on the occasion of the swearing in of Harris, the first woman, the first Black and South Asian American to the office of Vice President.\n\nBut today the color purple was also as simple as 1, 2, 3. Paint by numbers: red + blue = purple. It was a call for unity to heal the great schism between the Republican and Democratic parties' reds and blues that have drifted into caustic, violent contention in the last 12 years."}

At night, the glitz and glamour of black-tie inaugural balls will be replaced by a star-studded virtual concert hosted by Tom Hanks streamed live and broadcast on the major networks.\n\nThere will be a mix of other events this week, including a memorial on Tuesday for the victims of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's what else you need to know about the inauguration of the 46th president of the United States.\n\nWhat events are leading up to Wednesday?\n\nSeveral days of virtual programming kicked off Sunday night with a concert, followed by events Monday on Martin Luther King Day devoted to service and promoted by President-elect Biden's inaugural committee.\n\nBiden spent some of the day volunteering at a Philadelphia hunger relief organization while Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, volunteered in D.C.\n\nOrganizers encouraged others to volunteer for Monday and beyond at bideninaugural.org/day-of-service.\n\nOn Tuesday night, a lighting ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool to honor people killed by COVID-19 will be held \"to memorialize American lives lost,\" the Presidential Inaugural Committee said.\n\nThe committee is inviting communities around the country to join the Washington ceremony by lighting up buildings and ringing church bells at 5:30 p.m. local time in \"a national moment of unity and remembrance.\"\n\nHow and when will Joe Biden arrive?\n\nPlans for Biden to take an Amtrak from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to D.C. were scrapped earlier this week in part due to heightened security concerns, according to CNN, which first reported the news. (A Biden inaugural spokesman said in response only that his travel plans had never been made public.)\n\nIt is not clear how he will now arrive in D.C., reports CBS News.\n\nBiden has, however, accepted an invitation to stay at the historic Blair House, across the street from the White House, the night before the inauguration. But it's unclear whether that's where he will be sleeping, according to The Washington Post.\n\nWhat are some of the other changes due to security?\n\nAmid concerns about another incident, in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, Biden's inauguration rehearsal, originally set for Sunday, was postponed to Monday, Politico reported Thursday night.\n\nThe move came after Biden and his team received a briefing last Wednesday about threats from the FBI, the Secret Service and national security officials, according to Politico.\n\nOn Thursday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the bureau was tracking an \"extensive amount of concerning online chatter,\" including calls for armed protests leading up to the inauguration.\n\n\"When we talk about potential threats, we have to say about that we are seeing an extensive amount of concerning online chatter about a number of events surrounding the inauguration,\" Wray said in his first briefing since the rioting at the Capitol, where five people died.\n\nThe National Mall will be closed and National Guard troops will be in place to keep Biden safe and thwart a possible repeat of the violence.\n\nHow many will be at the inauguration?\n\nA familiar theme of inaugurations past — crowd size — will be much downplayed this year, given the unusual circumstances."}

No, this isn't a movie\n\nThe inauguration was witnessed by several people and broadcast live by numerous outlets. Biden has been seen several times in the White House.\n\nClaims that the inauguration was fake or that Joe Biden is not the real president are not accurate. There's no evidence.\n\nA new conspiracy theory has blossomed among some people who believed that former President Donald Trump had an elaborate scheme to remain in office: that Biden's inauguration was fake, and he isn't the real president.\n\nThe theory started to gain traction online when the Jan. 20 \"storm\" disrupting Biden's inauguration didn't happen. It points to a myriad of ill-perceived discrepancies for what a real inauguration and presidency should look like.\n\nThese claims fall short. Biden is the real president and his inauguration was legit. The day's events were broadcast and live-streamed by several outlets including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC and PBS.\n\nThe event was much smaller this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. But we know it happened because it was witnessed and documented by elected officials, former presidents, military members, reporters, photographers and performers.\n\nSocial media posts and videos spreading the theory were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe debunked a variety of claims that argue the inauguration didn't happen and that Biden isn't the legitimate president.\n\n\"The White House's inauguration video was unlisted\"\n\nSome people on Facebook claimed that the White House's official inauguration video was unlisted on YouTube because it had more dislikes than likes.\n\nIndeed, the 34-minute video has many more dislikes than likes — currently 76,000 to 14,000 — but it is still up on the White House YouTube channel. Web archives show no record that the video was ever taken down.\n\n\"Biden's executive orders aren't available online\"\n\nAccording to one viral video, Trump's executive orders were available on the Office of the Federal Register website \"immediately,\" while there are still no sign of Biden's.\n\nThat's false. Biden's executive orders may not have been uploaded at the time the video was made, but the documents are published on the site now. The online register shows that it also took a few days for Trump's orders to be published after they were signed.\n\n\"Biden's granddaughters disappeared and reappeared in between frames of inauguration coverage\"\n\nSome claim that the inauguration was staged because Biden's granddaughters, who were standing behind him when he took the oath of office, suddenly disappeared in certain shots.\n\nThey didn't. Biden's granddaughters may not have been visible at certain points due to different camera angles, but they were present throughout the oath and did not move. They can also be seen standing behind Biden in photographs taken by Reuters and the Associated Press.\n\n\"Biden took a private plane to D.C.\"\n\nBiden's form of travel has nothing to do with the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nBiden originally planned to travel to Washington by train from Delaware, but that plan changed when it was deemed too great a security risk. So he took a private jet, which was also a break from tradition.\n\nUsually the outgoing administration provides a government plane to bring the president-elect to Washington for the inauguration. Trump, who refused to acknowledge Biden's victory until early January, opted to not attend the inauguration, becoming the first outgoing president in more than a century to skip the event.\n\nWe previously reached out to the White House, but couldn't confirm whether the Trump administration offered to provide transportation to the Bidens. CNN reported that \"a source familiar with the matter\" said the government didn't offer the Bidens a plane, but did not provide further details.\n\n\"Biden's Oval Office is a movie set\"\n\nSome social media users have shared photos of Biden in the Oval Office and say they provide proof that it's not the real presidential office but a movie set owned by Castle Rock Entertainment.\n\nFilm sets of the famous room exist, but there is no credible evidence that supports this. Biden made a public entrance into the White House on Jan. 20 and was photographed in the Oval Office shortly after. He has been seen in the White House several times in the days that have followed.\n\nSome point to a vehicle visible outside the window behind the Resolute Desk as Biden sits there, saying there is no parking lot in that location. But the Oval Office overlooks the South Lawn and has a private road and circular driveway, both places where the car could have been parked.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA conspiracy theory circulating on social media says that Biden's inauguration was fake and that he isn't the real president.\n\nThe evidence is paltry. Biden was legally inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20."}

Because of coronavirus, social visits only resumed in October, but many facilities have canceled them again as infections spiked.\n\nOne reason for the new nationwide lockdown is that the bureau is moving some of its Special Operations Response Teams from prison facilities to Washington, D.C., to bolster security after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Authorities are concerned there could be more violence, not only in the nation's capital, but also at state capitals, before Trump leaves office Jan. 20.\n\nA Bureau of Prisons spokesman said the agency was coordinating with officials at the Justice Department to be ready to deploy as needed. Earlier this month, about 100 officers were sent to the Justice Department's headquarters to supplement security staff and were deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service and given special legal powers to \"enforce federal criminal statutes and protect federal property and personnel,\" said the spokesman, Justin Long.\n\nThe specialized units typically respond to disturbances and other emergencies at prisons, such as riots, assaults, escapes and escape attempts, and hostage situations. Their absence can leave gaps in a prison's emergency response and put remaining staff at risk."}

DHS also warned that there may be violence incited against federal buildings, law enforcement and public officials.\n\nSocial media sites have tightened their content moderation since the deadly January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter has permanently banned the president, and Amazon kicked Parler off its web hosting services for failing to moderate content.\n\nOn Wednesday, Airbnb announced that all reservations in the Washington D.C. area next week have been canceled and no new reservations in the area will be allowed during that time.

Maybe America Is Gonna Pull Through.\n\n\"Don't give up,\" New Radicals begged us in their classic 1998 single \"You Get What You Give.\" And if they didn't take their own advice, if they never followed up on that pop song's promise, if they left our nation wanting a whole lot more, today is a day to celebrate. The band has reunited after 22 years to perform the song as part of the Biden-Harris virtual inaugural parade. It is a benediction for a next-level '90s pop song, an exclamation point at the end of a joyful day, a \"Don't Stop\" moment for a new generation.\n\nIt is, to borrow a phrase from our new President, a big fucking deal. Here's why.\n\nIf you're new to the Radicals, the band was essentially a duo: singer Gregg Alexander and percussionist Danielle Brisebois. Michigan-born Alexander had bounced around the music business as a little-known teenage pop artist in the late 1980s, while Brisebois achieved success as a child actor, starring in the later seasons of All In The Family and on Broadway as the original Molly in Annie. After Brisebois was recruited to sing backing vocals on Alexander's second solo album Intoxifornication, they went on to co-write tracks for her first, Arrive All Over You. If it had stopped with simply those two album titles, it would have been enough. But it didn't; there was a spark, they formed a band, and they got signed by MCA Records, because MCA Records knew what was up.\n\nMaybe You've Been Brainwashed Too was released in late 1998 to instant critical acclaim, and for good reason. It is what we would now call \"a mood,\" and a particularly good one. It is an early summer day all year long, an antidepressant with zero side effects. Alexander wrote and produced every track, finally nailing his unique sound, which has endured long after he disappeared. (More on that later.) Though the album is best known for its one hit single, it is banger city from start to finish.\n\nAnd oh that one hit single. \"You Get What You Give\" is the greatest pop-rock song of the last 25 years, and if you disagree, I need you to take a quiet moment and reflect on why you've chosen to reject pleasure. Though the song-ending call-outs of Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson still get most of the attention, the song itself is about the resilience of the human spirit. Its chugging piano is the sound of a soul struggling to see the bright side. The song gave us the word \"frenemies,\" and the video sent me on a still-fruitless search for that windbreaker. It is the perfect jam for a tense time in history, a song whose optimism is hard-won.\n\nFlatiron Books Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose Flatiron Books Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose Now 72% Off $8 at Amazon\n\nIt is for that reason that the song has significance to the Biden family. In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, President Biden reveals that his son Beau used \"You Get What You Give\" as a psych-up song for his chemotherapy treatments, and when it became clear that his brain cancer was inoperable, the family continued to play it for him to keep his spirits up. In honor of Beau, First Gentleman Doug Emhoff uses it as his walk-on music. It's in the pantheon.\n\nNew Radicals dissolved before their second single \"Someday We'll Know\" was released, as Alexander found the spotlight too stressful. But even if you didn't know it, you still had their music in you. Brisebois co-wrote Natasha Bedingfield's \"Unwritten,\" while Alexander lent his signature sound to Santana & Michelle Branch's \"The Game Of Love,\" the Oscar-nominated \"Lost Stars\" from Begin Again, and what pop historians unanimously recognize as our greatest blowjob anthem, \"I'm Gonna Blow Your Mind\" by Carly Hennessy, who would later go on to American Idol fame as Carly Smithson. Dude's been busy."}

For one to say something after last week's event would be noteworthy and rare enough. For all eight Joint Chiefs to speak out together — in a \"message to the Joint Force,\" no less — shows just how perilous they deem this moment to be.\n\n\"The violent riot in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 was a direct assault on the U.S. Congress the Capitol building, and our Constitutional process,\" the letter signed by all the Joint Chiefs reads. \"We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection.\"\n\nWhile that may be a general statement about the insurrection meant more for the public, the next section was clearly meant for the troops they help lead.\n\n\"As Service Members, we must embody the values and ideals of the Nation. We support and defend the Constitution,\" they wrote. \"Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law.\"\n\n\"President-elect Joe Biden,\" they concluded, \"will be inaugurated and will become our 46th Commander in Chief.\"\n\nThere are likely two main reasons why Joint Chiefs Chair Army Gen. Mark Milley and the seven others felt the need to pen the letter.\n\nFirst, veterans and possibly even some active-duty troops were allegedly involved in the attack on the Capitol last week. That means the military community certainly contains people who wrongly believe the presidential election was stolen, subscribe to the QAnon conspiracy theory, or have far-right tendencies.\n\nRegardless of their passions or views, military leaders aim to keep the armed services as apolitical as possible. Otherwise, some might associate the military with one party or another, and that isn't healthy for a democracy.\n\nSecond, the Joint Chiefs tend to speak out when something really egregious has happened, and there's no question the Capitol insurrection fits the bill. \"[T]hey have developed a finely tuned 'political' (small p) radar on when to weigh in,\" CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nFor example, after President Donald Trump said some attendees at the 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville were \"very fine people,\" all the Joint Chiefs spoke out against racism and bigotry. \"The Army doesn't tolerate racism, extremism, or hatred in our ranks. It's against our Values and everything we've stood for since 1775,\" Milley, who was chief of staff of the Army then, said at the time.\n\nBased on this letter, it looks as though America's top military officials won't tolerate another thing: the attempted overthrow of American democracy by force."}

Thank a Chicago-founded company that 'wanted it big.'\n\nThe smash ending to a smash day in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday was Katy Perry singing \"Firework\" as, appropriately enough, fireworks went off around the Washington Monument behind her. Many, many fireworks.\n\nThat display, a stunning four minutes or so, was created by Strictly FX, a company founded in Chicago in 1996 that does most of its pyrotechnics business with touring rock shows and events like the Super Bowl. And it served as the finale to the \"Celebrating America\" prime-time television special devoted to President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Inauguration Day.\n\nThe internet exploded afterward, mostly congratulating Perry for her performance. The fireworks were credited mostly as backdrop. That's fine with Adam Biscow and FX; Biscow is the designer that created the show, the guy who put the white burst directly behind Perry's outstretched hand just as she hit her final chorus and elicited a breathless \"Oh yeah!\" from host Tom Hanks as he signed off the show.\n\nSpeaking with the Tribune from the Washington Mall on Thursday, he said shows like Wednesday's are a team effort. Strictly FX, which moved its headquarters to Nashville in 2018 but maintains an office in Mount Prospect as well as California, created the show, with the shells fired by Garden State Fireworks of New Jersey, which holds the contract to do fireworks in the city and is a frequent collaborator.\n\n\"We don't do shows like this for the credit,\" Biscow said. \"We do it for the love of what we do, it's little piece of history we got to take part in.\"\n\nStrictly FX also did the show for Biden's victory speech in Wilmington, Delaware, in November that got attention for its use of drones, and Biscow said the president-elect came in and thanked the crew personally afterward.\n\nIn this image from video, singer Katy Perry performs during the \"Celebrating America\" event on Wednesday, following the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States. (AP)\n\nBiscow declined to give a dollar figure for the cost of Wednesday's show, but allowed that it used about 20,000 shells fired from two separate launch areas, one a chain of nine zones behind the monument itself, the other in West Potomac Park. The sky filled behind the Washington Monument was about 2,000 feet wide, choreographed to the song. At moments the sky was a riot of dripping silver — those streaming explosions are called brocade shells and are a favorite of his — and at others a wall of brilliant red, with the edges of the bursts just touching each other."}

So getting back to just the pure intelligence. It was all over the board,\" McCarthy explained when asked about preparations for crowd control. \"It was very hard to make that determination of what you're dealing with,\" he told reporters on a call, adding that the Defense department relied on law enforcement threat assessments. Through the weekend, 6,200 National Guard personnel will deploy to the nation's capital and remain in the region for a minimum of 30 days. The month-long mobilization ensures that the National Guard members will be on hand for the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. The troops, who are unarmed, will monitor traffic control points and provide support to law enforcement as authorities work to secure the perimeter surrounding the Capitol Building one day after a mob supporting President Donald Trump stormed it.\n\nThe mobilization comes as the nation continues to process Wednesday's startling riot in which at least four people died. All four living former presidents have condemned the day's events, in which a violent mob disrupted lawmakers from the typically perfunctory process of formally confirming Biden's victory. The D.C. National Guard was mobilized during the riots and about 1,100 troops were sent to assist local police in tamping down the insurrection, the Pentagon said. The deployment came after Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requested the force, two sources told NBC News. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo all announced plans to send National Guard troops to D.C. as well. Trump, who spoke at a rally to protest the results of the election shortly before his supporters infiltrated Congress, still has not condemned the rioting or conceded defeat. He encouraged demonstrators to be peaceful after they stormed the Capitol."}

And in a particularly noteworthy moment, Biden cited a \"rise of political extremism, white supremacy, [and] domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.\"\n\nBiden is not the first US president to discuss racism in his inaugural address. In Barack Obama's first speech as president, he observed that \"a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.\" President George W. Bush in 2005 and president Bill Clinton in 1997 both acknowledged the persistence of racism in the US.\n\nBut Biden is the first to specifically acknowledge the existence of white supremacy. That's an important sign of the way that the popular understanding of racism in the US has evolved in recent years, and of how Biden may approach racial inequality in office.\n\nAs the New York Times explained last fall, for the past few decades, the American mainstream media was more likely to reserve the phrase \"white supremacy\" to describe Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan—hate groups that claimed their own bigotry and had an explicit agenda to kill and/or oppress people of color and Jewish people.\n\nBut over the past 10 years, influential people like writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and activist-athlete Colin Kaepernick have helped to not only popularize the term, but to broaden its application to refer not only to those who explicitly embrace white supremacy. In the current parlance—and particularly in the wake of the widespread discussions about racism that began last summer—white supremacy is understood as a force enacted through systems and institutions that benefits white people while oppressing non-white people, evident in everything from the US legal system to the way corporations hire.\n\nWhite supremacy is particularly useful as a term that encapsulates the ways racism can be reinforced independently of individual prejudice. \"People have this misconception that [white supremacy] has something to do with hate or racial animus, and it doesn't,\" journalist Michael Harriott explained in an interview last summer. The fact that majority-white schools have more funding than majority-Black schools, or that Black people are disproportionately more likely to be shot and killed by police, are illustrations of white supremacy in action."}

Wade that still leaves many reeling, is starting a new term with justices slated to revisit the issue of LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn 303 Creative v. Elenis, the court will return to the issue of whether or not providers of custom-made goods can refuse service to LGBTQ customers on First Amendment grounds. In this case, the business owner is Lorie Smith, a website designer in Colorado who wants to opt out of providing her graphic design services for same-sex weddings despite the civil rights law in her state.\n\nJennifer Pizer, acting chief legal officer of Lambda Legal, said in an interview with the Blade, \"it's not too much to say an immeasurably huge amount is at stake\" for LGBTQ people depending on the outcome of the case.\n\n\"This contrived idea that making custom goods, or offering a custom service, somehow tacitly conveys an endorsement of the person — if that were to be accepted, that would be a profound change in the law,\" Pizer said. \"And the stakes are very high because there are no practical, obvious, principled ways to limit that kind of an exception, and if the law isn't clear in this regard, then the people who are at risk of experiencing discrimination have no security, no effective protection by having a non-discrimination laws, because at any moment, as one makes their way through the commercial marketplace, you don't know whether a particular business person is going to refuse to serve you.\"\n\nThe upcoming arguments and decision in the 303 Creative case mark a return to LGBTQ rights for the Supreme Court, which had no lawsuit to directly address the issue in its previous term, although many argued the Dobbs decision put LGBTQ rights in peril and threatened access to abortion for LGBTQ people.\n\nAnd yet, the 303 Creative case is similar to other cases the Supreme Court has previously heard on the providers of services seeking the right to deny services based on First Amendment grounds, such as Masterpiece Cakeshop and Fulton v. City of Philadelphia. In both of those cases, however, the court issued narrow rulings on the facts of litigation, declining to issue sweeping rulings either upholding non-discrimination principles or First Amendment exemptions.\n\nPizer, who signed one of the friend-of-the-court briefs in opposition to 303 Creative, said the case is \"similar in the goals\" of the Masterpiece Cakeshop litigation on the basis they both seek exemptions to the same non-discrimination law that governs their business, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, or CADA, and seek \"to further the social and political argument that they should be free to refuse same-sex couples or LGBTQ people in particular.\"\n\n\"So there's the legal goal, and it connects to the social and political goals and in that sense, it's the same as Masterpiece,\" Pizer said. \"And so there are multiple problems with it again, as a legal matter, but also as a social matter, because as with the religion argument, it flows from the idea that having something to do with us is endorsing us.\"\n\nOne difference: the Masterpiece Cakeshop litigation stemmed from an act of refusal of service after owner, Jack Phillips, declined to make a custom-made wedding cake for a same-sex couple for their upcoming wedding. No act of discrimination in the past, however, is present in the 303 Creative case. The owner seeks to put on her website a disclaimer she won't provide services for same-sex weddings, signaling an intent to discriminate against same-sex couples rather than having done so."}

The proceedings moved at lightning speed, with lawmakers voting just one week after violent pro-Trump loyalists stormed the U.S. Capitol, egged on by the president's calls for them to \"fight like hell\" against the election results.\n\nTen Republicans fled Trump, joining Democrats who said he needed to be held accountable and warned ominously of a \"clear and present danger\" if Congress should leave him unchecked before Democrat Joe Biden's inauguration Jan. 20.\n\nTrump is the only U.S. president to be twice impeached. It was the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in modern times, more so than against Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nThe Capitol insurrection stunned and angered lawmakers, who were sent scrambling for safety as the mob descended, and it revealed the fragility of the nation's history of peaceful transfers of power. The riot also forced a reckoning among some Republicans, who have stood by Trump throughout his presidency and largely allowed him to spread false attacks against the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi invoked Abraham Lincoln and the Bible, imploring lawmakers to uphold their oath to defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign \"and domestic.\"\n\nShe said of Trump: \"He must go, he is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\"\n\nHoled up at the White House, watching the proceedings on TV, Trump later released a video statement in which he made no mention at all of the impeachment but appealed to his supporters to refrain from any further violence or disruption of Biden's inauguration.\n\n\"Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week,\" he said, his first condemnation of the attack. He appealed for unity \"to move forward\" and said, \"Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for. ... No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement.\"\n\nTrump was first impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine, but the Senate voted in 2020 acquit.

Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, told senators that the then-chief of the Capitol Police requested military support in a \"voice cracking with emotion\" in a 1:49 p.m. call as rioters began pushing toward the Capitol. Walker said he immediately relayed the request to the Army but did not learn until after 5 p.m. that the Defense Department had approved it. Guard troops who had been waiting on buses were then rushed to the Capitol, arriving in 18 minutes, Walker said.\n\nThe hourslong delay cost the National Guard precious minutes in the early hours of the Jan. 6 rioting, with Walker saying he could have gotten personnel into the building within 20 minutes of getting approval. As it stood, the support did not happen until the evening. The delay also stood in contrast to the swift authorization for National Guard deployment that Walker said was granted in response to the civil unrest that roiled Washington last June as an outgrowth of racial justice protests.\n\nA senior Pentagon official who testified, Robert Salesses, said then-acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller wanted to take time to understand precisely how National Guard troops would be used at the Capitol and what assignments they would be given. Mindful of criticism that the response to the demonstrations last spring was heavy-handed, military officials were also concerned about the optics of a substantial National Guard presence at the Capitol, and thought such visuals could inflame the rioters, Walker said.\n\n\"The Army senior leadership\" expressed \"that it would not be their best military advice to have uniformed Guardsmen on the Capitol,\" Walker said.\n\nThe Senate hearing was the latest in a series dedicated to the government's preparations and response as a mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters laid siege to the Capitol. Taken together, the hearings have spelled out the challenge law enforcement officials face in sorting through an ocean of unverified tips but also highlighted how police inadequately prepared for the Trump loyalists; that FBI warnings about the threat of violence did not reach top police officials; and that requests for aid were not promptly answered.\n\n\"Anytime there's an attack, we in the FBI want to bat 1,000, and we want to not ever have this happen again,\" said Jill Sanborn, the bureau's top counterterrorism official and one of the witnesses. \"So we're asking ourselves exactly the questions that you're asking: Is there a place that we could have collected more (intelligence)? Is there something we could have done?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Capitol Police disclosed the existence of intelligence of a \"possible plot\" by a militia group to breach the Capitol on Thursday. The revelation, coming as the acting police chief was testifying before a House subcommittee, differed from an earlier advisory from the House sergeant-at-arms that said police had no indication that any such violence was planned."}

But he mentioned nothing about whether an investigation will also looking at how the race of the rioters also played a part.\n\n\"Make no mistake -- these mass riots were not First Amendment activities; they were criminal riotous behavior,\" Sund said in his statement. \"The actions of the USCP officers were heroic given the situation they faced, and I continue to have tremendous respect in the professionalism and dedication of the women and men of the United States Capitol Police.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., one of the first politicians to demand Sund's resignation, announced on Feb. 15 that Congress will move to establish an independent commission to investigate how the Capitol riot evolved and why law enforcement seemed unprepared.\n\nThe Senate will hold its first public hearing on the Capitol insurrection on Tuesday."}

Why was it so easy for rioters to get past security? Why didn't Capitol Police have more officers in the building and at the entrances? What must terrorists think of our seat of government's security?\n\nThe presidential inauguration is only days away. There must be better security for that event than what we saw Wednesday.\n\nPolitical violence is inexcusable, no matter who is committing it, and public safety is crucial to protect individual freedoms and equal protection under the law.\n\nWhile Black Lives Matter protests have sometimes turned violent, and Antifa has a long history of association with violence, pro-Trump demonstrations have mostly been peaceful in the past. This may have put Capitol Police in an erroneously relaxed posture.\n\nBut public safety officials must always be prepared for the possibility that instigators and political opportunists might goad a crowd to violence.\n\nWashington has dozens of law enforcement agencies, each with different jurisdictions. But unlike the other agencies that report to the city or the federal executive branch, Capitol Police are part of the legislative branch. They report to congressional leaders.\n\nThe day of the riot, Capitol Police was worked with the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department, the U.S. Secret Service (a division of the Department of Homeland Security), and U.S. Park Police (a division of the Interior Department), as it commonly does, to make our public spaces secure, accessible, and protect the process of democracy.\n\nCapitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned Thursday effective Jan. 16, stated that the Capitol attack was unlike anything he had ever experienced in his 30 years of law enforcement in Washington. Rioters attacked Capitol Police officers and other uniformed law enforcement officers with metal pipes, chemical irritants, and other weapons.\n\n\"They were determined to enter into the Capitol Building by causing great damage,\" Sund said.\n\nMore than 50 Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department officers sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol.\n\nSeveral Capitol Police officers were hospitalized with serious injuries, and one officer died of his injuries, in addition to the Trump supporter who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer.\n\nLaw enforcement in Washington often has to maintain law and order while allowing Americans to practice their First Amendment rights. In many scenarios, this is a challenging balance to strike.\n\nSund's description of the clashes with Capitol Police sounds familiar because it is. The tactics used in the riot last week resemble those used in riots that occurred in multiple cities throughout 2020. Law enforcement officers and buildings around the U.S. have been attacked with pipes, rocket-grade fireworks, and other dangerous weapons since May by Antifa and Black Lives Matter criminals.\n\nThe difference is the 2020 riots occurred in the dark of night and most of the mainstream media showed little of the rioters' violence, downplaying the attacks as \"peaceful protests.\"\n\nSlowly, information is coming forward that bad actors at prior riots were involved at the Capitol riot as well. Some rioters wore the typical black bloc garb and helmets, others donned Trump paraphernalia to blend in. At a minimum, Wednesday's assault on the Capitol was fully informed by the lessons of previous actions.\n\nThe rioters had watched the tactics and techniques of the Antifa criminals (which included violence, weapons, and destruction) and the nearly non-existent legal repercussions meted out by liberal city and state governments (the vast majority of criminals who were arrested were released without charges), as well as the validation the earlier rioters received (such as having streets named for them).\n\nIt is critical that Capitol Police and other law enforcement prepare for Inauguration Day and other mass demonstrations where opinions are strongly divided, causing emotions to run high, by using the successful enforcement tactics during the 2020 riots.\n\nFortunately, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Capitol Police have started doing so.\n\nDuring the Capitol riot, additional National Guard units were called in; Bowser set a curfew and extended her emergency order for 15 days, which will cover the inauguration.\n\nAt the request of Capitol Police, Homeland Security installed additional protective fencing Thursday around the perimeter of the Capitol grounds, a tactic the department used to protect U.S. courthouses and other federal property in Portland, Oregon, and other cities during the 2020 riots.\n\nMeanwhile, law enforcement agencies have made dozens of arrests and requested information on numerous individuals photographed inside the Capitol."}

Some of Trump's supporters were armed and ready for war: an Alabama man allegedly parked a pickup truck with 11 homemade bombs, an assault rifle and a handgun two blocks from the Capitol hours before authorities discovered it, according to federal prosecutors. Another man allegedly showed up with an assault rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, telling acquaintances he wanted to shoot or run over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pipe bombs were found near the headquarters of the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee as authorities tried to dispel the mob and secure the Capitol.\n\nBut three days later, Trump appears no more aware of the consequences of his actions than on the day of the riot when he delighted in the mayhem. Bunkered at the White House with an ever-shrinking circle of aides, he has offered no remorse for inciting the crowd and offered only a forced denunciation of their actions. Aides, weary and disgusted, refuse to come near him. His central line to the outside world, Twitter, was severed Friday night. People who admired him, worked for him and followed him down dark paths before now say he has crossed into a delusional place, entirely detached from reality."}

The bill now goes to the Senate where its future was uncertain.\n\nThe solid number of Republicans voting for the independent investigation -- 35 out of 211 -- signaled some cracks in the party's defense of Trump on a key vote. Trump opposes the creation of a commission.\n\nAll 10 of the House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January voted for the commission.\n\nThe bipartisan outcome could give Senate Republicans second thoughts about working to defeat the initiative.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat, said McCarthy \"got what he asked for\" in a compromise on the structure of the commission, which would be charged with wrapping up its investigation by Dec. 31. McCarthy is a close ally of Trump.\n\nEarlier in the day, McConnell announced he would not support the House bill, calling it \"the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced proposal\" and saying existing congressional investigations are sufficient.\n\nIn the 50-50 Senate - controlled by Democrats only because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast tie-breaking votes - Republicans can block the legislation. At least 60 votes are needed to advance most bills.\n\n\"There will continue to be no shortage of robust investigations,\" said McConnell, who in January said that the mob that attacked the Capitol was \"fed lies\" and \"provoked\" by Trump and others.\n\nPELOSI'S BACKUP PLAN\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she could launch regular committee hearings with \"full subpoena power\" to investigate the riot if Senate Republicans block the commission.\n\n\"But that's not the path we have chosen to go,\" Pelosi added, explaining that a bipartisan, outside investigation was needed to win the public's trust in any findings.\n\nThe 10-member commission would produce a public report including recommendations for preventing another Capitol attack. It would be charged with examining security and intelligence failures surrounding the riot in which Trump's supporters, after he delivered an incendiary speech, interrupted the formal congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November election.\n\nDuring debate, Republican Representative John Katko said, \"An independent 9/11-style review is critical for removing the politics around Jan. 6.\"\n\nKatko helped craft the legislation with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat.\n\nThe House bill, unveiled last week, would give Republicans equal power with Democrats in appointing commissioners and equal say over witnesses.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will schedule a debate on the legislation. Schumer accused Republican leaders of \"caving to Donald Trump and proving that the Republican Party is still drunk off the Big Lie\" that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was stolen from Trump through massive voter fraud."}

Trump's first impeachment trial, which took place in February 2020, ended in an acquittal of charges that he tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate now-President Joe Biden.\n\nThe second trial's outcome was not a surprise as the bar to convict would have required a significant bipartisan vote at a time when the US is extremely partisan – more deeply polarised politically than it has been in decades.\n\n\"This trial wasn't about choosing country over party, even not that this was about choosing country over Donald Trump and 43 Republican members chose Trump. They chose Trump,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said following the vote.\n\nTrump, for his part, released a statement calling the trial \"yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country.\"\n\n\"No president has ever gone through anything like it,\" Trump added.\n\nDemocrats had hoped that Republicans, who had experienced the riot first-hand and were deliberating at the scene of the crime, would cause them to put politics aside and vote for conviction.\n\nWhile the vote reflects the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats, it also magnifies the deep divisions within the GOP between pro-Trump lawmakers and those that feel he should be held accountable.\n\nThe arguments\n\nHouse Democratic impeachment managers framed their argument around the charge that Trump laid the groundwork for violence through his baseless insistence that the presidential election results were fraudulent. They laid out in detail evidence they argued showed he told the mob to come to Washington, DC on January 6, gave them their marching orders and then refrained from calling off the rioters after the violence started.\n\nThe Democrats played graphic videos of rioters storming the Capitol mixed with Trump's remarks he made and tweets he sent throughout. Over the course of two days, Democrats argued that it was plainly obvious that Trump incited the events that transpired on January 6.\n\n\"It's now clear beyond doubt that Trump supported the actions of the mob and so he must be convicted. It's that simple,\" lead House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin said during closing arguments on Saturday.\n\nTrump's defence team argued his speech was not \"incitement\" and was allowable under constitutional free-speech protections.\n\n\"To claim that the president in any way wished, desired or encouraged lawless or violent behaviour is a preposterous and monstrous lie,\" said Michael van der Veen, one of Trump's lawyers, on Friday.\n\nTrump's defence lawyers also argued that the Democrats' presentation was misleading, filled with \"doctored evidence\" and called the trial \"political theatre\" driven by Democrats who have had it out for Trump since he announced his first presidential campaign six years ago.\n\n\"Since my client stepped in, they have been possessed overwhelming zeal to vanquish an independent-minded outsider ... and to shame, demean, silence and demonize his supporters,\" van der Veen said during his closing arguments on Saturday.\n\nSpeedy trial\n\nLawmakers from both parties had hoped for a quick trial, and they received their wish. Five days is the fastest presidential impeachment trial, by far, in US history."}

Wednesday afternoon that \"we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, and we're going to the Capitol,\" they didn't wait. They started to march right away.\n\nEven as Trump continued to speak, I watched them begin to peel off, first a few, and then hundreds. One guy looked at me taking photographs and said, \"It's almost over. We have to get to the Capitol!\"\n\nThey moved quickly. The mood had been lighter earlier in the day, like a Trump-themed Comic-Con. But it darkened fast. Under banners like \"GOD, GUNS, GUTS & GLORY,\" protesters—I was still thinking of them as protesters, not rioters, at that point—screamed at counterprotesters along the side of the street, calling them \"cheaters\" and breaking into a steady, robotic chant of \"TRUMP WON! TRUMP WON!\"\n\nAs we got closer to the Capitol steps, there was some excitement: Fellow marchers had breached the building, people said. I wasn't sure what that meant. As we got closer, though, I saw these marchers ripping open doors and climbing through windows. When I got to the doors, police had managed to close them again. There was a core group of young people at the very front, just outside, trying to force their way in.\n\nThere were a few cops, but not nearly enough. As I approached the door, I identified myself as press, and one cop started using my body to push people behind me backward. I heard one say to the other, \"The best we can do is slow them down.\" I rolled around them and walked straight in.\n\nDirectly inside, I saw no cops. As \"Don't Stop Believin' \" blared from a speaker somewhere, large crowds chanted \"USA! USA!\" A man screamed about the American people's will. The entryway was already messed up. Rioters were smashing the windows, and there was wooden furniture piled up and destroyed. I saw a man in a conference room with his feet up. He and his friends were smoking weed, and when we clocked each other, they offered me a joint.\n\nIn another room, people were lounging and rummaging through furniture. They put up stickers and scrawled slogans like \"Trump Won\" and \"Our House.\" Some invited me to take their picture. One young guy put his feet up on one of the desks, posed, and told me, \"Yeah, this is my desk. I paid for this.\"\n\nAt one point, I'm pretty sure I saw Gavin McInnes, the Proud Boys founder, strolling around inside in military-style gear. Others seemed to notice too: I heard murmurs of \"Hey, it's Gavin.\" (Update, Jan. 7, 2021: McInnes says he was in New York on Wednesday and added: \"I was adamantly against this rally from day one.\") Not long after, a \"Boogaloo Boy\" who wouldn't give me his name shouted at me about currency and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe mood was giddy, but it was chaos. Everyone was excited. People were chanting, \"This is our America,\" and \"Whose house? Our house!\" They were having fun, entertaining themselves. The priority seemed to be to have their friends take selfies with them inside the Capitol.\n\nThe people I managed to speak to didn't seem to understand the gravity of what they had done. Inside a building they had broken into, they described themselves as \"peaceful\" to me. I talked to a kid from Florida, who must have been no more than 17 or 18. He told me, \"This is nothing compared to what antifa does.\" I said, \"Look, they're breaking the glass.\" He answered, \"Yeah, but at least they're not destroying the things.\" I showed him pictures of things destroyed. It didn't register. On the way up, there was a woman holding a sign saying, \"If we were leftists, we would be rioting.\"\n\nEven amid the \"fun,\" there were some very aggressive rioters. People shouted \"fake news\" and attacked journalists. I saw a group of people scream at a female journalist who had an accent, \"Get out of my country!\" I got away with only one woman incensed I took her picture. I kept the picture and walked away. (I later learned that police shot and killed a woman inside, and there are frightening videos of rioters storming different parts of the building, but I wasn't there for either incident.)\n\nEventually, I did see some cops inside. They seemed to be standing by, waiting for orders. I've been to plenty of protests in the past year, and let me tell you: They don't usually wait for orders. I've never seen anything like it. There was a guy smoking a cigarette, and a cop actually walked over, gently placed his hand on the guy's shoulder, and asked him to put it out. And that was it.\n\nEventually, word must have come down. The cops started to smack through crowds with their batons and push them back. They pepper-sprayed people. Eventually, the officers retook the concourse outside the House side of the Capitol by using percussion grenades and tear gas. They had a fire extinguisher that appeared to be filled with pepper spray that they would explode in people's faces to keep them outside. By then, rioters were using barricades to try to smash back through the doors. They were trashing the place.\n\nOutside again, people were livid with the police. They chanted \"Traitors!\" and told them, \"We had your back. We're on your side!\" But the cops just stood there solemnly in their riot gear."}

You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\"\n\nHis supporters listened. Thousands of Trump supporters, waving Trump or Confederate flags and wearing MAGA gear, descended upon the Capitol. They overwhelmed law enforcement, pushed past police barricades, and temporarily stopped Congress from counting electoral votes.\n\nTrump's supporters had gathered earlier in the day for the \"Save America\" rally organized by a group called \"Women for America First.\" Trump allies, including former campaign staffers, helped promote the event, ABC News reported. Trump's White House schedule showed he was to speak at the rally that day.\n\nSome of Trump's fiercest allies also made incendiary statements at the rally. \"Let's have trial by combat,\" said Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, warming up the crowd for Trump.\n\nWe looked closely at the words Trump used to urge his supporters to show up and \"fight\" on his behalf Jan. 6.

After he racked up defeats in court, Trump's tactics turned toward ordering senators to \"fight\" for him.\n\n\".@senatemajldr and Republican Senators have to get tougher, or you won't have a Republican Party anymore. We won the Presidential Election, by a lot. FIGHT FOR IT. Don't let them take it away!\" he tweeted Dec. 18.\n\nIn December, Trump also issued a battle cry to his supporters broadly, encouraging them to gather on his behalf Jan. 6.\n\nDec. 12: On the day of pro-Trump rallies in Washington, D.C., Trump tweeted \"Wow! Thousands of people forming in Washington (D.C.) for Stop the Steal. Didn't know about this, but I'll be seeing them! #MAGA.\"\n\nDec. 12: \"WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!!\" Trump said in another tweet.\n\nDec. 19: Trump tweeted his praise for a report by his adviser Peter Navarro alleging election fraud: \"A great report by Peter. Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"\n\nDec. 26: Trump tweeted: \"The 'Justice' Department and the FBI have done nothing about the 2020 Presidential Election Voter Fraud, the biggest SCAM in our nation's history, despite overwhelming evidence. They should be ashamed. History will remember. Never give up. See everyone in D.C. on January 6th.\"\n\nDec. 27: \"See you in Washington, DC, on January 6th. Don't miss it.

The more video angles of that day the better.\"\n\nJan. 4: At a rally in Georgia the day before the Senate runoffs, Trump repeated his grievances about his own election. He spoke about a continued fight, both for himself and the Senate.\n\n\"If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House — and they're not taking this White House — we're going to fight like hell, I'll tell you right now,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We're going to take it back,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat Trump said before the riot\n\nTrump's final direction to supporters came during his \"Save America\" rally around noon Jan. 6, when he repeated his Pants on Fire claim that he won.\n\n\"Our country has had enough,\" Trump told his supporters. \"We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about. To use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.\"\n\nThe crowd later chanted: \"Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump!\" Trump thanked them.\n\nTrump praised the crowd for traveling from across the nation and for \"the extraordinary love.\"\n\n\"We're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: to save our democracy,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump repeatedly said there was a need to \"fight.\" After he bashed \"weak\" Republicans and Biden, he said: \"Unbelievable, what we have to go through, what we have to go through and you have to get your people to fight. If they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight. You primary them. We're going to let you know who they are, I can already tell you, frankly.\"\n\nHe continued with the fighting metaphors: \"Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer, and we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. We're going to have to fight much harder, and Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us. And if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our constitution. Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy.\"\n\nTrump then invited the crowd to go to the Capitol."}

Pelosi, D-Calif., asked retired Army Lt. Gen.

Though most of the charges brought so far have been misdemeanors, acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin said Tuesday the Justice Department was considering bringing sedition charges against some of the rioters, effectively accusing them of attempting to overthrow or defeat the government.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Sherwin said. \"We're going to focus on the most significant charges as a deterrent because, regardless of it was just a trespass in the Capitol or if someone planted a pipe bomb, you will be charged and you will be found.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has created a specialized strike force to examine the possibility of sedition charges, which could carry up to 20 years in prison. Officials said they were utilizing some of the same techniques in the riot probe as they use in international counterterrorism investigations, examining the money flow and movement of defendants leading up to the breach. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called for the rioters to be added to a no-fly list, a tool most commonly associated with terrorisms investigations.\n\nThe statements by FBI and Justice Department officials on Tuesday were intended as both a defense of federal law enforcement preparations before the deadly riot and as a warning to participants. But they also raised new questions about the coordination across agencies for the Jan. 6 riot, which was sparked by Trump's calls for his supporters to fight Congress' vote confirming President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the riot, some law enforcement officials, including the Capitol police chief, said they were unaware of serious concerns leading up to Jan. 6 and had prepared only for a free-speech protest.\n\nBut on Tuesday, The Washington Post reported on the existence of a Jan. 5 report from the FBI's field office in Norfolk, Virginia, that forecast, in detail, the chances that extremists could commit \"war\" in Washington the following day. Steven D'Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office, said that once he received the Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through the joint terrorism task force.\n\nD'Antuono was among the officials who suggested law enforcement had simply been caught off guard, saying on Friday: \"There was no indication that there was anything other than First Amendment protected activity.\"\n\nHe did not explain the discrepancy in his statements, though he suggested Tuesday that the Norfolk warning was based on nonspecific information in terms of individual leads to investigate, characterizing it as a \"thread on a message board\" that was not attributable to any specific person.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday night, the FBI said the report's author had warned that the \"FBI might be encroaching on free speech rights\" in pursuing further action, and that the document itself did not necessarily associate the comments with a national security threat or crime. It highlighted D'Antuono's remarks at the news conference suggesting that without knowing the identity of the people whose words were cited in the report, there was not much that could be done with the information.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police and other official didn't immediately respond to questions about their own initial assessments of the threat.\n\nA U.S. defense official familiar with the discussions said Tuesday that Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was not notified about the FBI warning.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that it is unclear whether any defense or military officials heard about the notification from the FBI, but that statements in recent days from all the leaders indicate they weren't aware that violence of that level was expected at the Capitol."}

There was no direction. No plan. And no top leadership.\n\nOne cop ran from one side of the building to another, fighting hand-to-hand against rioters. Another decided to respond to any calls of officers in distress and spent three hours helping cops who had been immobilized by bear spray or other chemicals.\n\nThree officers were able to handcuff one rioter. But a crowd swarmed the group and took the arrested man away with the handcuffs still on.\n\nInterviews with four members of the U.S. Capitol Police who were overrun by rioters on Jan. 6 show just how quickly the command structure collapsed as throngs of people, egged on by President Donald Trump, set upon the Capitol. The officers spoke on condition of anonymity because the department has threatened to suspend anyone who speaks to the media.\n\n\"We were on our own,\" one of the officers told The Associated Press. \"Totally on our own.\"\n\nThe officers who spoke to the AP said they were given next to no warning by leadership on the morning of Jan. 6 about what would become a growing force of thousands of rioters, many better armed than the officers themselves were. And once the riot began, they were given no instructions by the department's leaders on how to stop the mob or rescue lawmakers who had barricaded themselves inside.

It turned out he was sheltering with Vice President Mike Pence in a secure location for some of the siege. Sund resigned the next day.\n\nHis assistant chief, Yogananda Pittman, who is now interim chief, was heard over the radio telling the force to \"lock the building down,\" with no further instructions, two officers said.\n\nOne specific order came from Lt. Tarik Johnson, who told officers not to use deadly force outside the building as the rioters descended, the officers recounted. The order almost certainly prevented deaths and more chaos, but it meant officers didn't pull their weapons and were fighting back with fists and batons.\n\nJohnson has been suspended after being captured on video wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat while moving through crowds of rioters. Johnson told colleagues he wore the hat as a tactic to gain the crowd's confidence as he tried to reach other officers who were pinned down by rioters, one of the officers said. A video of the incident obtained by the Wall Street Journal shows Johnson asking rioters for help in getting his colleagues.\n\nJohnson, who could not be reached for comment, was heard by an officer on the radio repeatedly asking, \"Does anybody have a plan?\""}

This doesn't mean members of Congress and staff are under investigation, but the FBI is checking the veracity of the claims, the officials said.\n\nCounterterrorism strategy for arrests\n\nAt least some of the arrests already made are part of a strategy used in counterterrorism investigations, to find even a minimal charge and try to take a person of concern off the streets. That helps ease the possible threat amid concern about possible attacks on the inauguration, officials believe.\n\nOn January 4, for example, local police arrested the leader of the Proud Boys, Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, in Washington, DC.\n\nTarrio was taken into custody for allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after an earlier \"Stop the Steal\" rally. The Miami resident was charged with destruction of property related to the banner, however, federal authorities say they found Tarrio in possession of two high-capacity firearm magazines, prompting them to add a charge of Possession of High Capacity Feeding Device.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal authorities in New York City arrested Eduard Florea, 40, on at least one weapons charge after law enforcement, including the FBI and NYPD, responded to a Queens home in response to online postings about an armed caravan heading to the US Capitol, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN.\n\nLaw enforcement sources told CNN that the man claims to be a Proud Boy and was arrested with live ammunition in the home.\n\nAlready, the public efforts by prosecutors and the FBI to encourage people who participated In the riot to turn themselves in is yielding fruit. Some attorneys have reached out to arrange for safe surrender of their clients in order to gain a measure of leniency and lessen the chance of a police raid on their homes, two officials said.\n\nFor instance, a counterterrorism prosecutor even appeared in court for an early hearing for one of the defendants on Tuesday, signaling how integrated the Justice Department's effort already is between the typical criminal prosecutors who handle initial criminal hearings and with the units focused on more complex crimes.\n\n\"With this strike force that was established to focus strictly on sedition charges, we're looking at in treating this just like a significant international counterterrorism or counterintelligence operation,\" DC US Attorney Michael Sherwin said Tuesday.\n\n\"We're looking at everything: money, travel records. Looking at disposition, movement, communication records. So no resource related to the FBI, or the US Attorney's Office will be unchecked in terms of trying to determine exactly if there was a command and control how it operated and how they executed these, these activities.\""}

Ron Johnson in recent weeks as he has sought to downplay the violence committed by supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\nTestifying publicly for the first time since pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol nearly two months ago, Wray was pressed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin on whether the FBI has seen any evidence that individuals involved in the January 6 attack were posing as Trump supporters – a claim the Illinois Democrat called \"the next big lie.\"\n\n\"We have not seen evidence of that, at this stage, certainly,\" Wray responded when Durbin asked if he had seen any evidence the riot was organized by \"fake Trump protesters,\" referring to comments Johnson made during a Senate hearing last week in which he also claimed those involved in the attack were \"agents provocateurs.\"\n\nMost Republicans on the panel did not embrace these conspiracies, but the baseless claim that left-wing infiltrators were responsible for the violent attack has been promoted by Trump's impeachment lawyers, several GOP lawmakers and at least one speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wray made clear that Antifa and other left-wing groups were not part of the violence on January 6, which he called \"domestic terrorism\" – even as several Republicans sought to use the hearing as an opportunity to highlight the threat posed by those groups rather than focus on the Capitol attack.\n\n\"We have not, to date, seen any evidence of anarchist violent extremists or people subscribing to Antifa in connection to the 6th,\" Wray told the Senate committee.\n\nMore than 260 defendants – many of them professing allegiance to Trump, disgust for Congress, and supportive of revolution – have been charged in federal court related to their actions in and around the US Capitol siege on January 6.\n\nPreviously, nearly a dozen Trump supporters charged in connection with the US Capitol insurrection have said that Antifa and other left-wing groups weren't involved in the attack, further debunking the conspiracy among Trump supporters.\n\nAdditionally, Wray testified Tuesday that the FBI is \"not aware of any widespread evidence of voter fraud that would have affected the outcome in the election,\" undercutting a false narrative that was repeatedly pushed by Trump and his allies during the 2020 campaign.\n\nMany Republicans on Capitol Hill have continued to push unfounded accusations of widespread election fraud, which Trump critics have taken to calling \"the Big Lie,\" in the weeks since the January 6 attack despite evidence that such claims helped fuel the deadly riot and warnings they continue to motivate domestic extremists.\n\nWray dodges opportunity to denounce lawmakers who endorse QAnon\n\nWhile Wray spent much of Tuesday's hearing dispelling dangerous false claims, he dodged an opportunity to denounce lawmakers who endorse the QAnon conspiracy theories.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said he was \"disappointed\" Wray sidestepped an opportunity to condemn elected officials who have amplified the QAnon claims when asked if they are contributing to the threat of domestic extremism by doing so.\n\n\"Well, certainly we are concerned about the QAnon phenomenon which we view as a sort of loose, sort of set of conspiracy theories, and we've certainly seen domestic violent extremists of the sort that you're describing, who cite that as part of their motivation. And so that's something that we do,\" Wray said.\n\nBlumenthal interrupted Wray for not immediately condemning the idea that lawmakers support the insurrectionists and asked the question in another way: \"When members of Congress, as has happened endorse the QAnon theory, doesn't it worsen the threat of violence?\"\n\nBut Wray still did not take the opportunity to denounce the behavior, prompting Blumenthal to make clear he was disappointed by the response and intends to follow up on the issue in another setting.\n\nIn October, CNN reported that several congressional candidates engaged with the QAnon conspiracy theory of those mentioned, Marjorie Taylor Greene went on to win a seat in Georgia's 14th Congressional District.\n\nWray pressed on 'Norfolk memo'\n\nWray's team of federal investigators is currently chasing thousands of leads in twin efforts to prosecute people involved in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and to try to prevent feared follow-up attacks in Washington and around the country."}

I expected police in military gear and a response as aggressive as I've come to anticipate covering and observing protests over the past year, where a single water bottle thrown at a cop line can bring a volley of tear gas and percussion grenades in retaliation.\n\nInstead, I easily walked into the Capitol perimeter. At the entrances to the building, there were a few Capitol Police officers helplessly trying to hold a line at the doors, but they were vastly outnumbered. The officers had somehow gotten the doors back closed, but within minutes, rioters were easily pushing past them again. Once I was inside, too, I saw no officers at all for a stretch, as rioters plundered and destroyed furniture. When I did, it was even more surreal: They looked as if they were there loitering themselves. Some were equipped with riot gear, others not, but most just stood there and watched. Some rioters stopped to ask them for directions. In one of the only direct interactions I saw, a Capitol officer asked a rioter to put out a cigarette, then walked away.\n\nI'd never seen law enforcement show this level of restraint at any protest, much less a riot. And now we know why. A damning new report by the Capitol Police's own inspector general, Michael A. Bolton, presented at a Capitol Hill hearing today, portrays a police force that recklessly disregarded intelligence and hobbled its own response at every turn.\n\nWith around 140 officers injured and one dead, there was some passing of the buck in the immediate aftermath of the riot. Republicans were in denial. The former Capitol Police chief, Steven Sund, resigned almost immediately. He wrote in a letter, \"Perfect hindsight does not change the fact that nothing in our collective experience or our intelligence—Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and D.C. Metropolitan Police (MPD)—indicated that a well-coordinated, armed assault on the Capitol might occur on Jan. 6.\" Sund repeated this assertion in testimony in front of a U.S. Senate committee just weeks ago: \"None of the intelligence we received predicted what actually occurred,\" he said.\n\nThat account stands in direct contrast to the new report, in which Bolton found that Capitol Police leadership dismissed threat assessments and forbade rank-and-file officers from appropriately responding to the threat. The New York Times reviewed a copy of the document and reported that the Capitol Police's own intelligence warned three days before that \"Congress itself is the target on the 6th.\" There were warnings about who would be in the crowd: \"Stop the Steal's propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members and others who actively promote violence may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike.\" Bolton's report also unearthed pre-insurrection warnings from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, which had relayed to the Capitol Police that a map of the Capitol's tunnel system had turned up on pro-Trump message boards.\n\nBut the 104-page report found that, rather than ramp up security, the officers on duty were ordered to carry only limited riot-prevention equipment and to not carry stun grenades. Bolton wrote that \"heavier less-lethal weapons were not used that day because of orders from leadership.\" He added that the unit was \"operating at a decreased level of readiness as a result of a lack of standards for equipment\" that diminished \"operational readiness.\""}

Legally, it will be more difficult.\n\nAs thousands clad in Donald Trump hats and wielding Trump flags stormed the US Capitol last Wednesday, it was Trump's own words just prior to the riot urging them to \"fight\" that is being blamed for the violence that ensued.\n\nAccording to the House resolution laying out the article of impeachment the US House of Representatives is expected to debate this week, it was Trump's speech at the Ellipse, just across the street from the White House, that is the evidence for their allegation that Trump \"engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States\".\n\nThe resolution states that \"shortly before the Joint Session\" to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory \"commenced, President Trump ... reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide'\".\n\n\"He also willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged – and foreseeably resulted in – lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore',\" the resolution continues.\n\n\"Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he addressed ... unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts.\"\n\nThe House impeachment effort boils down to Trump's uttering of \"if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore\".\n\nImpeachment versus legal guilt\n\nThe impeachment process is inherently a political one, not a legal one, meaning while members of Congress generally refer to legal language when considering whether a president committed \"high crimes and misdemeanours\", there is no requirement that Congress needs to legally prove that the accused is guilty of those crimes, though generally there is a lot of effort to gather as much evidence as possible.\n\nBecause the process is driven by politics, it is therefore driven by American sentiment towards the accused president and whether a majority of Americans agree with the accusations. In this case, a poll released on Sunday is the first indication that impeaching Trump might not be a very controversial move.\n\nIn the ABC News/Ipsos poll, 67 percent of Americans said Trump deserves a great deal or good amount of blame for the riot, including 69 percent of independents but only 31 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe same poll suggested that 56 percent of Americans think Trump should be removed from office before his term ends on January 20.\n\nThat is a significant difference from when Congress impeached but failed to remove Trump from office in 2019-2020. Last year, Americans were split throughout the entire process, with a clear majority never materialising to punish Trump.\n\nThe difference in Americans' opinions is a likely indicator the process this time around could move more quickly with much less controversy. Certainly, the political winds will give members who vote to impeach significant political cover against those who argue this process is happening too quickly, dispensing with the traditional lengthy investigation and deliberation given to previous successful impeachment efforts.\n\nBut just because Congress says Trump is guilty of \"inciting\" the riot, does not mean he is guilty in the eyes of the law. Congress's actions could result in Trump being removed from office or preventing him from holding office again, but it does not meet the legal bar of actually holding him liable for the illegal behaviour and destruction of the Capitol caused by the rioters.\n\nAnd that legal bar is quite high, according to experts.\n\nThe former District of Columbia assistant attorney general, Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, who has experience successfully – and unsuccessfully – convicting protesters for incitement, argues Trump did not violate any incitement laws with his speech.\n\nShapiro, who currently serves as a Trump appointee to the US Agency for Global Media, pointed out in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Sunday: \"In the District of Columbia, it's a crime to 'intentionally or recklessly act in such a manner to cause another person to be in reasonable fear' and to 'incite or provoke violence where there is a likelihood that such violence will ensue'.\"\n\nIn addition to the \"fight\" language the House resolution cites, Shapiro mentions that another of Trump's lines from his speech is being held up as evidence of incitement: \"We're going to cheer on brave senators and congressmen and -women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\""}

But much of the most significant video capturing the most severe violent crimes from that day still can't be seen.\n\nThat's because the Justice Department and the federal courts haven't proactively made available footage from surveillance cameras around the Capitol and from DC Metropolitan police officers' body cameras.\n\nLast week, the public finally began to see some of that video, because a group of 16 major media outlets led by CNN sued for access. The video releases – just a few in the media coalitions' continued pursuit of dozens – come as some Republicans, inspired by former President Donald Trump's election lies, are denying what happened on January 6, despite injured law enforcement officers like DC Police's Michael Fanone pushing for officials to acknowledge the Trump supporters' unlawful brutality that day.\n\nThe effort to get footage released has taken months. In some cases, the videos became evidence in public portions of Capitol riot defendants' cases weeks ago. But it hasn't even been seen by reporters covering the court proceedings because of the peculiarities of video technology, the unprecedented sweep of the insurrection investigation and structural approaches in the federal court system.\n\nRolling the tapes in court\n\nCNN's work to view video used in court began in March. Two months after the insurrection, federal defendants were appearing in court each day by the dozen. As defendants came through DC District Court following their arrests in their home states, judges held waves of hearings about whether to detain each of them. At those hearings, prosecutors needed to prove the alleged dangerousness of each defendant, showing how violent some were on January 6, especially toward police. The best way to do it, in many cases: Roll the January 6 tapes.\n\nThe tapes showed from police officers' perspectives and unflinching surveillance cameras the violence of the pro-Trump crowd – law enforcement colleagues beaten and dragged and crushed in doorframes; police lines collapsing, completely overwhelmed.\n\nTypically the court press corps sits in the courthouse to watch hearings where these moments are laid out in excruciating detail. But because of coronavirus restrictions, we could only listen to DC federal court proceedings over the phone. The judges, lawyers and defendants, however, recreated their courtrooms over Zoom videoconferences.\n\nAnother technological hitch kept these videos out of sight: While most evidence used in early federal criminal proceedings gets posted on an online public docket, called Pacer, that system can't house videos.\n\nAs these limitations became more apparent every day, CNN and other news outlets started pushing for access. Thousands of hours of video became core to the Justice Department's prosecution of the siege – an overwhelming trove of evidence that would be rolled out gradually to prove scene by scene the behavior of hundreds of rioters.\n\nIn one case, against riot defendant Emanuel Jackson, NBC wrote to his judge and received limited access to a video from the case. In another, Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the court to post videos on its website from the case against the so-called \"Q Anon Shaman\" Jacob Chansley, who had become famous for posing with a horned headdress and a spear-tipped flagpole at the vice president's desk in the Senate.\n\nThen the Justice Department arrested two pro-Trump ralliers for spraying Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who later died, and two other officers with mace-like chemicals along the police line at the front of the Capitol building. It was a significant break in a major January 6 assault case.\n\nThe West Virginia court where one defendant, George Tanios, first appeared allowed reporters to view his detention hearing as a livestream video. Prosecutors played videos of the Sicknick attack one after another, showing how each officer physically reacted to the assault. The judge in West Virginia, Michael Aloi, called the video of Sicknick \"surreal\" and noted how he was impacted by the severity of the chemical spray hitting the officers' faces."}

Bush, said: \"The government's filing sends a clear message... No leader in our government is acting within the scope of his employment when he acts to subvert the free and fair election by getting people to go up and riot and interfere.\"\n\n\"The leaders who perpetrated these travesties are personally responsible for their actions.\" he added. A spokesman for Brooks could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nHarrowing scenes from the U.S. Capitol siege\n\nBrooks and Trump are co-defendants in a lawsuit by Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell that accuses them of inciting people during a Jan. 6 rally to attack the Capitol and stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nTrump is a defendant in two other similar lawsuits, one filed by Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson and another on behalf of two U.S. Capitol police officers.\n\nTrump has so far not publicly requested Justice Department protection in the case, nor has his attorney Jesse Binnall said whether he intends to ask the department to take a position.\n\nIn a statement, Binnall said: \"The Supreme Court has been clear that presidents cannot be sued for actions that are related to their duties of office. Addressing Americans about congressional action is a quintessential presidential duty.\"\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThe department riled some Democrats, with a pair of recent decisions that seemed to shield Trump or members of his administration, though legal experts said the moves were intended to protect the office of the presidency, not its former occupant.\n\nTrump's primary legal defense in the Swalwell suit has not rested on the Westfall Act but on a legal doctrine that argues the separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution broadly grants the president immunity during his time in office.\n\n\"Rousing and controversial speeches are a key function of the presidency. That is especially true when, as is the case here, the President is advocating for or against congressional action,\" his lawyer wrote in a May 24 filing.\n\nIn a footnote, the lawyer added: \"Even if former President Trump is not covered by absolute immunity, as a governmental actor, the claims against him are also foreclosed by immunity under the Westfall Act.\"\n\nAttorney Anne Tindall of the advocacy group Protect Democracy said the department's filing contains a lot of signs that are \"bad news for Trump.\"\n\n\"Trump's role is even more limited than Brooks' is,\" said Tindall, who is representing two Capitol Police officers in a separate lawsuit alleging Trump incited the riot."}

(AP) — A crank caller ordered an \"insurrection pizza\" from Pauline Bauer's restaurant. A profane piece of hate mail addressed her as a domestic terrorist. She even became a punchline for Stephen Colbert's late-night talk show on CBS.\n\nA swift backlash greeted Capitol riot suspects like Bauer when they returned to their homes across the U.S. after joining the mob that stormed past police barricades, smashed windows and disrupted the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory on Jan. 6. Relatives, friends or co-workers reported scores of them to the FBI. Some lost jobs. Others lost their freedom, jailed awaiting trials.\n\nIn Bauer's hometown in rural Pennsylvania, her arrest and that of a longtime friend have rekindled partisan bickering, more often on social media than on street corners, some residents say. As Bauer and William Blauser Jr. fight the charges in court, many in the town of Kane have struggled to comprehend how two of their neighbors could be among the hundreds of Trump loyalists bent on overturning the election that day.\n\n\"I think it was totally outrageous, it was illegal and I think it was treasonous,\" said Joe Lanich, who operates a letterpress print shop with his wife called The Laughing Owl Press Co. in Kane's uptown business district. He said the town is populated by proud residents who work hard to improve Kane and \"don't want to see one person paint us in a bad light.\"\n\nBauer tries to shrug off the scorn from strangers, but acknowledges her actions have angered some in her community.\n\n\"Some people didn't like the fact that I became political,\" she said during a break in dinner service at her restaurant, Bob's Trading Post.\n\nIn the months since Jan. 6, former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray the rioters as peaceful patriots even as videos from that day show members of the mob beating police officers and hunting for lawmakers in an unthinkable attack on the seat of American democracy. On Tuesday, officers who defended the Capitol that day described to a congressional committee investigating the insurrection how they feared for their lives and continue to suffer physical and emotional pain.\n\nBauer was heard shouting at police to \"bring Nancy Pelosi out\" to be hanged during the riot, the FBI says. Five people died in the attack or its aftermath, and dozens of law enforcement officers were injured. More than 500 people have been charged with federal crimes.\n\nEven so, some in Kane have stood by Bauer, who insists her actions haven't cost her any friendships or harmed her business. On a recent Wednesday evening, tables at her restaurant were filled by her regular customers.\n\n\"She's a human being who stood up for her rights. She should have a right to stand up for what she believes in,\" said Glenn Robinson, 68.\n\nSuch political division over how Jan. 6 unfolded has occurred in communities across the country. Forty-seven percent of Republicans say it can be described as a \"legitimate protest,\" while only 13% of Democrats say the same, according to a June poll from Monmouth University.\n\nA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 81% of Democrats say it's \"extremely\" or \"very\" important that investigations continue into what happened during the Capitol breach, but just 38% of Republicans say the same.\n\nBauer was arrested in May along with Blauser, a Vietnam War veteran and retired mail carrier. Surveillance video shows the two of them entering the Capitol through an east Rotunda door where at least three police officers were trying to block entry. Video from a police officer's body camera captured Bauer saying to bring out Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House.\n\n\"Bring them out now. They're criminals. They need to hang,\" she said.\n\nTrump received nearly three-quarters of the votes in the 2020 election in the county that incudes Kane, a borough in northwest Pennsylvania with roughly 3,500 residents, over 97% of whom are white. Many homes and businesses in town are still decorated with Trump signs and flags. A warehouse adorned with pro-Trump posters also has one that reads \"Burn Loot Murder,\" a derisive reference to the Black Lives Matter movement."}

Democrats are now calling on formal investigations, citing an unusual uptick in visitors sporting MAGA gear the day before the attempted coup. But few other details have been released.\n\n\"Let's be clear, there's no way those groups could have gotten into the Capitol without a Member of Congress or a staff member of a member of Congress,\" said U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat from New Jersey.\n\nCapitol riot arrests: See who has been charged\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we know so far:\n\nWhat's been alleged?\n\nSome members of Congress, including those who say they're trained to spot suspicious activity from their time in the military, said in a letter that they witnessed an usual number of outside groups visiting the complex on Jan. 5, the day before the riot. They allege some of those visitors may have been involved in the deadly insurrection the following day.\n\nThe letter, which demands that the House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police investigate the link between those visitors and the subsequent violence in the Capitol, garnered more than 30 signatures.\n\nThose lawmakers say that the building has been mostly closed to the public since March 2020 and cited \"a concerning departure from the procedures\" the day before the riot. The letter also notes that these visitors appeared to be associated with the Trump rally, but offered no other details. It goes on to question whether there were any sign-ins, logbooks, video footage or facial recognition software available. The letter also questions the tracking involved for staff members who want to bring official guests into the building and which other agencies have potentially accessed these records.\n\nSome members of Congress grew suspicious because the only people who could have facilitated such tours, they contend, are fellow lawmakers. One Democrat said the emergency call buttons were removed from her office. Another said pipe bombs found earlier in the day were a clear diversionary tactic to get Capitol Police to leave the perimeter. Many have also questioned how the rioters knew their way around the maze of the Capitol so quickly and why only liberal offices appear to have been targeted.\n\n\"Stop the Steal\" organizer Ali Alexander further exacerbated these theories when he claimed that three Republican House members – Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama – had helped him plan the rally. Biggs and Brooks have explicitly denied a role. Gosar has not commented on his alleged involvement.\n\nWho is investigating?\n\nCongressional Democrats have asked the House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police to investigate the link between the visitors and riots. It's unclear exactly where that status of that probe stands. Other agencies, including the FBI and Metropolitan Police, have helped with criminal investigations into the various individuals arrested, but it's unclear if they're examining the possible connections to GOP lawmakers.\n\nWho was involved in the tours?\n\nThe Democrats haven't named names, but some have suggested the visitors mostly consisted of Trump supporters, which would not necessarily be usual taken by itself. It's also not clear if they spotted individual members of Congress helping get anyone inside.\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, told reporters in the Capitol Wednesday he'd heard names of lawmakers who gave tours but didn't want to say until he got verification. \"I don't want to throw any member under the bus,\" he said.\n\nFederal law and safety rules amid the coronavirus pandemic prohibit members of the public from entering the building. All public tours have been canceled since March 2020, and only lawmakers, staff, media and their guests with proper credentials are allowed in.\n\n\"Who's responsible for this thing?\" said Rep.

Then they headed to the Capitol. Members of smaller white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups also were spotted in the crowds. Police were photographed stopping a man identified as a leading promoter of the QAnon conspiracy theory from storming the Senate floor.\n\nOnline forums popular with Trump supporters lit up with gleeful posts about the chaotic scenes broadcast from the Capitol. Thousands of messages on Parler, a right-wing alternative to Twitter, included the hashtag #civilwar or other variations of the term.\n\n\"If you're surprised, you haven't been paying attention,\" said Integrity First for America executive director Amy Spitalnick. \"We should all be horrified by this, but nobody should be surprised that this is happening.\"\n\nSpitalnick's civil rights group is backing a federal lawsuit filed by victims of the violence that erupted at the August 2017 white nationalist \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left a counterprotester dead.

Instead, Citi (C)bank accidentally wired almost 100 times that amount, including $175 million to a hedge fund. In all, Citi (C) accidentally sent $900 million to Revlon's lenders.\n\nSome lenders did return the money, but others did not. Citibank filed a lawsuit in August seeking the return of its funds, but it still has not received $500 million from 10 investment advisory firms after the accidental transfer.\n\nAn exception to the rule\n\nThe law usually punishes those who spend money accidentally deposited in their accounts. Accidental transfers are common in the digital age, and wires can be paid back instantly.

Revlon lenders said they believed Citibank was wiring prepayments for a loan. After all, the money accidentally wired was the exact amount \"to the penny\" Citibank owed them, although the loan wasn't set to mature for quite some time.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with Judge [Jesse] Furman's thoughtful, thorough and detailed decision,\" said Benjamin Finestone, who represented two lenders, Brigade and HPS Investment Partners.\n\n'Borderline irrational'\n\nThe court ruled the lenders were justified in believing the payment was intentional.

Though the law generally requires money mistakenly wired to be returned to its sender, Furman in his ruling cited an exception in New York that allows recipients to keep funds if they discharge a valid debt and if the recipient is not aware of the mistake upon its receipt of the funds. Because the payment was applied to existing loans, and the lenders did not make any misrepresentations to induce the accidental repayment, Furman said the wire transfers were \"final and complete transactions\" and not subject to revocation. The decision follows what Furman called \"one of the biggest blunders in banking history\": a full loan repayment of $893 million that Citibank mistakenly wired when it simply intended to pay approximately $7.8 million in interest (some lenders returned part of the overpayment). In an emailed statement to Forbes, Citigroup said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the court's decision and intends to appeal the ruling. Shares of Citigroup are edging up 0.7% Tuesday, pushing the stock's one-year gain to about 6.5%.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe blunder in August added fuel to regulatory scrutiny facing Citigroup over its internal record-keeping practices, and in October the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined the bank $400 million for deficiencies in risk management, data governance and internal controls. After the bank's accidental repayment, a slew of lawsuits against receiving lenders helped Citi recoup about $400 million from the accidental repayment.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"It appears that no mistake of the size or nature of Citibank's had ever happened before . . . [and] faced with these circumstances, the non-returning lenders believed, and were justified in believing, that the payments were intentional,\" Furman ruled on Friday. \"Indeed, to believe otherwise—to believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion—would have been borderline irrational.\"\n\nChief Critic"}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAlex Khmelevskiy, the head of UX design at Clay — a design and branding agency based out of San Francisco — examined Citigroup's wire transfer and said the mistake could have been easily avoided with a more user friendly interface.\n\n\"The UI looks like it came from the early '90s, which is a problem on its own,\" Khmelevskiy told Insider.\n\nCitigroup Revlon payment on Flexcube Court filing\n\nA Citigroup spokesperson told Insider the company is working to update its loan operations platform.\n\n\"We take pride in the role that we play as a global leader in financial services and recognize that an operational error of this nature is unacceptable,\" the spokesperson told Insider. \"We have put significant, additional controls in place until the new system is operational.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the interface provider, Oracle, declined to comment.\n\nFederal judge Jesse Furman ruled last week that Citigroup will not be able to recoup half a billion dollars of its own money after it accidentally sent Revlon creditors nearly $1 billion.\n\nCitigroup made the costly mistake over the summer. Instead of transferring a $7.8 million interest payment to the cosmetic company's lenders, the bank transferred the full loan amount.\n\nThe bank notified the creditors within 24 hours that it had not intended to pay the full amount, which was not due until 2023. Some firms returned the money, but 10 others refused to return about $500 million of the funds, prompting Citigroup's failed lawsuit to recoup the payment.\n\nThe blunder was the result of the failure to check the right boxes for the wire transfer\n\nCitigroup — like many commercial banks — uses Flexcube, a third-party application system from Oracle designed to help perform tasks like wire transfers.\n\nCitigroup subcontractors are responsible for entering the transaction information into the Flexcube database in order to initiate the transfer process.\n\nOn Flexcube, the easiest way to perform a transaction is to enter the principal amount into the system. The principal amount is directed to a \"wash account\" within the bank, while the payment triggers the interest to be sent out automatically to lenders.\n\nFor the Revlon payment, the subcontractor in India checked the box labeled \"principal\" and entered the digits for an internal Citigroup wash account. Three people signed off on the transaction.\n\n\"Looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash,\" the supervisor wrote when he approved the transaction, according to the court filing.\n\nThe mistake was not realized till the next morning when the full amount was sent out to the 10 different creditors.\n\nIt turned out, the subcontractor needed to check two more boxes. In order to send the principal payment to the wash account, the subcontractor must also check the boxes for \"front\" and \"fund,\" setting them to the internal Citigroup account as well.\n\n\"Minor changes\" to Flexcube could have spared the bank from the blunder altogether\n\nKhmelevskiy's agency has worked with several large scale tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Slack. He said there are many ways the platform could have been improved to avoid the $500 million mistake.\n\n\"Even if we put the look and feel aside, just adding more clear instructions for each field and using more human-friendly language and terms would improve it drastically,\" Khmelevskiy said. \"Even a minor change such as a confirmation dialog with an overview of what is about to happen could help Citi avoid making this mistake.\"\n\nIn his decision, the judge said he hoped other banks would learn from Citigroup's mistake and implement more steps to minimize the risk of errors — an accident which the judge calls the result of a \"fat finger.\"\n\nThe judge based his ruling off a previous case, stating that it was reasonable for the creditors to keep the funds because they matched what the lenders were owed.\n\n\"To believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion — would have been borderline irrational\" Furman said in the ruling."}

Three employees using poorly designed software accidentally sent $900 million to one of its client's creditors instead of $7.8 million — then when creditors refused to return most of the money, a judge ruled in favor of the creditors.\n\nThe judge blamed \"human error\" in his decision, pointing out that:\n\nThe instruction manual for the banking software, Flexcube, explained how to perform this kind of transaction.\n\nCiti uses a \"six eyes process\" — meaning that three Citi employees reviewed Flexcube's transfer screen, to approve the transaction.\n\nFlexcube warned that funds would be sent out of the bank, but not the amount.\n\nHowever, that explanation misses the bigger picture: If three experienced employees agree on what they expect the software will do, but it does something else, that indicates an interaction design defect that caused the human error.\n\nAvoiding mistakes is one of the six ways better employee user experience (UX) drives better business results. It's rarely as dramatic as a single $500 million incident — at most companies, it's a steady drumbeat of avoidable mistakes that cost time and money and could have been prevented through better UX design. This is a design debt interest payment that almost every business is paying day after day, year after year.\n\nThe Design For Work Opportunity\n\nBusinesses are waking up to the upside opportunity in improving UX design for employees. Already, about half of design teams work on employee-facing software. And based on Forrester's analysis of the $150 billion-plus design industry, that number is going to grow.\n\nCiti has many dedicated professionals working on UX for its consumer app and site, both of which are much better designed than that screen in Flexcube, based on Forrester's UX reviews of apps and sites for banking customers. Citi probably even has a team dedicated to employee-facing software as most large firms do. However, that team is probably overstretched and wishes they'd had the chance to improve this interaction in Flexcube. If you were Citi, wouldn't you invest in fixing that defect right now? How many other UX issues lurk inside of businesses waiting to cause major or minor mistakes? And how many other companies are in the same boat? Again, this is interest paid on Citi's design debt — and it's likely to come due again.\n\nIt's not just internal teams either — software vendors are being forced to improve UX or face dire consequences. How would you like to be Flexcube right now, knowing that your product caused a customer to lose $500M, and that your competitors are telling all your prospects about it? And consider just how much frustrating software employees interact with every day. Every single one of the vendors of those tools is at risk of being abandoned in favor of a better designed replacement. Just look at commerce suites, for one example among many.\n\nThere have been plenty of major mistakes caused by bad UX before, of course: The tragic accident of the USS John McCain in 2017 that was caused by confusing controls; the Hawaii nuclear missile test warning gone awry in 2018; Three Mile Island's 1979 meltdown exacerbated by a convoluted control room. And there are minor ones every day that affect us. These issues are everywhere and at every scale.\n\nMaking It Better Requires Effort And Expertise — And Pays Off\n\nSo what's the first step to improving this situation? Recognizing there's a problem: Our research has found that most organizations assume employees will use whatever tool they're asked to, so most companies put minimal effort into design as long as the functionality exists, even if it's unnecessarily convoluted and obscure. They may have been able to get away with that in the past — but less and less so, now."}

How could a banking giant make a blunder of such staggering magnitude despite multiple checks and balances? So what exactly went wrong here?\n\nI recently circled back to that story and realized that it was, unsurprisingly, more complicated than it had sounded at first blush. Nevertheless, as software developers and software users, I suspected we could learn quite a bit from this expensive mistake along with our customers.\n\nI want to unpack a few of those lessons—but first, let's review what happened.\n\nICYMI: What Happened in the Citibank Wire Transfer Case\n\nThe bare-bones version of the story goes like this: Citibank, acting as the administrative agent for Revlon's loan, meant to process $7.8 million in interest payments to Revlon's lenders. However, Citibank's software system required that it set up and execute what was, in effect, a \"dummy\" transaction to process the interest payment. Citibank would create a transfer of the entire outstanding balance, including both principal and interest, into an internally held \"wash account.\" Citibank's staff had to check not just one clearly labeled box but also two other boxes with cryptic and confusing labels to direct the funds to the internal account. Because they only checked the one box, the money, totaling about $900 billion, didn't go to the wash account—it was wired straight to the creditors. (A rather large oops!)\n\nCitibank realized its error within 24 hours and asked the lenders to return the mistakenly transferred money. Some did, but several lenders refused due to a strange quirk of New York law: the \"discharge-for-value\" exception. This defense applies when someone receives a payment that is, in fact, owed to them. That recipient can keep mistakenly sent funds so long as\n\nthe recipient did not fraudulently induce the payment and\n\nthe recipient did not realize at the time of receipt that the money was sent by mistake.\n\nCitibank filed a lawsuit to recover the unreturned funds, which totaled about $500 million. Most of the facts in the litigation were simple. First, Revlon did owe its creditors, though the total amount was not due until 2023. Second, the payments the lenders received were correct payoff amounts, down to the penny. Third, the lenders—who weren't even expecting payments—did nothing to induce the payoff. So the only real question for the court was whether the lenders immediately realized that Citibank made a mistake when it sent the payments.\n\n...the only real question for the court was whether the lenders immediately realized that Citibank made a mistake when it sent the payments."}

He might have ruled differently if he could \"write on a blank slate,\" but there were legal precedents supporting the defendants.\n\n\"New York law wants to discourage banks from making these kinds of mistakes,\" said Adam Abensohn of Quinn Emanuel, who represented the asset managers. \"It's one thing to mistakenly send money to someone with no entitlement to that payment,\" he told DealBook. \"But there is nothing unfair about keeping that money when it's owed.\"\n\n\"At its heart, this case involves a clash between two basic intuitive principles,\" the judge said:\n\n\"If one party sends money to another by mistake, the latter should generally be required to give it back.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, if one party owes money to another and pays that money back to the penny, the latter should generally be allowed to keep and use the money as it wishes, without fear that the former will develop a case of borrower's remorse and claim that the payment was by mistake.\"\n\nWhere do you stand? The decision — which Citi will probably appeal — raises thorny questions about rules versus principles:\n\nSince it was a mistake by the bank, why not return the money?\n\nWhat responsibility do creditors have to the bank if it pays them back early?\n\nThis has generated a fascinating debate here at DealBook, and we'd like to hear what you think: Email us at dealbook@nytimes.com.

But a worker at outsourcing mega-org Wipro accidentally checked the wrong combination of on-screen boxes, leading to the repayment of not only the interest but also the $894m (£640m) principal from the bank's funds.\n\nCitibank has a \"six-eyes\" policy on massive money transfers of this type. In the Revlon fiasco, a Wipro worker in India configured the transfer using software called Flexcube, his local manager approved it, and Vincent Fratta – a Citibank senior manager based in Delaware, USA – gave the final OK for the transfer of funds, all believing the settings were correct.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the transfer set up by the first Wipro worker. He should have ticked not just the principal field but also the front and fund fields, and set their values to the necessary clearing account number. By leaving those two boxes unchecked and values empty – and wrongly assuming just putting the account number in the principal field was a correct move – the entire principal of the loan, which was set to mature in 2023, was handed back to 315 creditors.\n\nIncomplete ...

Source: US courts system\n\nIt wasn't until the next day that staff noticed the error, and sent out emails asking for the funds be returned – and hundreds of millions of dollars were. However, a group of 10 creditors refused to hand back their share the cash, amounting to more than $500m, leading Citibank to sue them in New York to recover the dosh.\n\nThis week, the US federal district court judge presiding over that lawsuit sided with the lenders, saying [PDF] they had reasonable grounds to think that the transfer was legitimate and that they had legal grounds to keep their money.\n\n\"The non-returning lenders believed, and were justified in believing, that the payments were intentional,\" Judge Jesse Furman ruled.\n\n\"Indeed, to believe otherwise — to believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1bn — would have been borderline irrational.\"\n\nSince the amount sent back repaid the loaned amounts to the cent and no more, the judge ruled Citibank had no right to reclaim the money.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with Judge Furman's thoughtful, thorough and detailed decision,\" Benjamin Finestone, representing two lenders, Brigade and HPS Investment Partners, told CNN."}

Deal volume was at record highs and showed no signs of letting up. Over at investment banking rival Goldman Sachs, young analysts made headlines with workplace horror stories that went beyond the typical long hours and cutthroat competition that Wall Street's known for. They were falling apart, mentally and emotionally.\n\nFraser saw an opportunity. And the memo she sent to Citi's 210,000 global staff would set the tone for how she would try to overhaul Citigroup — long languishing in third place and mired in bad press.\n\n\"The blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,\" she wrote. \"It's simply not sustainable.\"\n\nWhat followed was a reset plan that included the kinds of work-life balance measures you don't often see on Wall Street. Fraser implemented \"Zoom-free Fridays\" and urged staff to avoid scheduling calls outside traditional work hours. Take your vacations, she pleaded. Veteran bankers must have thought they were in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThen came the real shock: When Citi ultimately returns to the office, most roles will be designated as \"hybrid\" — with three days in office and up to two at home. Among American banks, that kind of flexibility was unheard of.\n\nIt was both a humane reaction to a mass trauma and a calculated strategic decision. By branding itself the \"bank with a soul,\" as Fraser calls it, Citi would have an edge in scooping up and retaining talent that might otherwise eschew Wall Street for the less-frenzied, or at least less formal, world of tech.\n\nFraser readily admits the decision wasn't purely about empathy — \"I want to crush the competition,\" she told Bloomberg News last month. But by not cracking the whip, she's also staking out a somewhat radical position on Wall Street: that ruthlessness doesn't have to define a bank's culture.\n\nBanking analysts and investors will be closely watching Fraser in March, when she plans to unveil Citigroup's cultural and structural rehabilitation plan for the next several years. It'll also mark her first full year as CEO — a timely check-in to see how her strategy is playing out.\n\nBy branding itself the \"bank with a soul,\" as Fraser calls it, Citi would have an edge in scooping up talent that might otherwise eschew Wall Street for the world of tech.\n\nNo one expects her to wave a magic wand and undo decades' worth of mismanagement overnight. But the March investor day will be a crucial early test. Shareholders are hungry for bold action. The biggest risk, says longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo, is not that the plan will be too aggressive — it's that it won't be aggressive enough.\n\nTurnaround job\n\nIt's hard to overstate what a difficult job Fraser, the first woman to lead a top American bank, has inherited.\n\nCitigroup's (C) stock is wildly underperforming. Its shares are up about 13% this year — dismal compared with the broader stock market, which has gained 24% in 2021. Citi's rivals are outpacing it by even more: Bank of America (BAC) is up 60%, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 35%.\n\nIt's also under intense pressure from regulators, who for years have been cajoling the bank to overhaul its hodgepodge of internal risk-management and data systems.\n\nRegulators' concerns aren't unfounded. In August 2020, Citi committed one of the biggest blunders in the history of Wall Street when it erroneously wired nearly $1 billion of its own money to creditors of Revlon. The fat-finger error ultimately cost Citi more than $500 million when several of those creditors refused to return the funds.\n\nJust two months later, regulators slapped Citigroup with a $400 million fine for failing to address \"long-standing deficiencies.\"\n\nFraser's shakeup of office culture is a relatively easy win — necessary, perhaps, but far from sufficient, analysts say.\n\n\"Every day she gets a grade from shareholders, and that's the stock price,\" Mayo said in an interview with CNN Business. \"And every day that she's been in the role, the verdict is Citigroup is worth more dead than alive.\"\n\nIt's not enough to change the tone at the top, Mayo said. Fraser, who declined to comment for this article, has to address the sort governance lapses that have gotten the bank in trouble.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Mayo and other analysts criticized Citi's decision to identify potential cash bonuses for top managers before their performance targets are even announced. \"That's like charging us for dinner before we know if we're getting hot dogs or caviar,\" the note said. \"Moreover, the awards are in cash vs. stock and seem like extra pay to execs for just doing their job.\"\n\nThat's terrible governance, Mayo says. \"And that's the terrible governance Citigroup has had for the last 10, 20, 50 or 100 years.\"\n\nBetter Call Jane\n\nThankfully for Citigroup, Fraser's no stranger to cleanup jobs.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, the bank very nearly collapsed because of its exposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities. As Citigroup hobbled along on life support in the form of a massive government bailout, Fraser — who joined the bank in 2004 —ran its strategy division, overseeing sales of risky assets to streamline the bank's sprawling operations.\n\nShe later ran Citigroup's battered mortgage business and its Latin America operations, both decidedly thorny assignments in the fallout of the financial crisis.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with CNN, Fraser recalled people telling her she was \"crazy\" for taking over CitiMortgage just a few years after the housing market imploded. In hindsight, she said, it was the \"best decision I've ever made.\"\n\nThe lesson: You don't have to know everything.\n\n\"You learn from those situations... Because it was a crisis and because I didn't know anything,\" she said. \"You have to hire people that are better than you and more knowledgeable than you.\"\n\nFraser is widely credited for cleaning up Citi's Mexican subsidiary, which was emerging from a money-laundering scandal when she became CEO of Citigroup's Latin America operations in 2015. In that role, she also steered the bank through the devastation of Hurricane Maria. When the storm forced Citi's San Juan, Puerto Rico, branch to close, she oversaw efforts to bring in generators and other necessities to get the bank back up and running a week later.\n\n\"We don't leave a country when it's in really bad shape,\" Fraser told the New York Times in an interview in February. \"We can really make a difference.\"\n\nFraser, 54, comes to the role of CEO armed with a resume straight out of Wall Street central casting. She worked as a Goldman Sachs analyst after receiving her degree in economics at Cambridge. Then came the Harvard MBA, followed by a decade of work at consulting giant McKinsey before joining Citigroup in 2004.\n\nA 'glass cliff' moment?\n\nFraser regularly downplays the gender question in interviews. The fact that she's a woman running a major bank is historic, but it should hardly matter as long she does the job well. And that's true. But it's also impossible to ignore Corporate America's track record of sticking a woman in the driver's seat when the wheels are about to come off.\n\nResearch shows that women are more likely to be promoted to senior leadership positions when institutions are in trouble — a trend known as the glass cliff. Mary Barra, famously, made history as the first woman to run General Motors in 2014. But the automaker was a mess, still crawling out of bankruptcy and, two weeks into Barra's tenure, issuing a massive recall linked to 13 deaths that the company had known about for years.\n\nThere was a similar sense of crisis at Citi that accelerated Fraser's ascension."}

Let's get into it.\n\nFROZEN OVER\n\nUnthinkably cold temperatures have knocked Texas' energy facilities offline.\n\nElectricity prices spiked more than 10,000% when the winter storm hit this week. There are blackouts across the state. More than 4 million Texans were without power early Tuesday.\n\nPOINTING FINGERS\n\nAlthough some are attempting to pin the blame on one fuel source or another, the reality is that the Arctic temperatures are hobbling fossil fuels and renewable energy alike, my colleague Matt Egan explains.\n\nIt's striking that these power outages are happening in mighty Texas, the energy powerhouse of America. A bit of context:\n\nTexas produces more electricity than any other US state — generating almost twice as much as Florida, the next-closest, according to federal statistics.\n\nTexas is the No. 1 state in both crude oil and natural gas.\n\nWind power is also booming in Texas, which produced about 28% of all the US wind-powered electricity in 2019.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nSo how did such a powerhouse get knocked so thoroughly offline?\n\nWe may not know the full definitive reason for a while, but a few things are clear:\n\nObviously, Texas winters ain't usually this cold. The state's infrastructure is simply not prepared for a deep freeze.\n\nCritics of renewables will try to blame wind turbines, but experts note that wind makes up a small share of Texas' energy consumption.\n\nIt's also worth poinitng out that a lot of chillier places have wind turbines that don't buckle in the cold — hello, Iowa; hej hej, Denmark — they just need to be winterized, a step experts said Texas has skipped.\n\nThe Lone Star State is ... all alone. Texas made a conscious decision to isolate its energy grid from the rest of the country. That means that when things are running smoothly, it can't export excess power to neighboring states. And in the current crisis, it can't import power either.\n\nIn other words: \"When it comes to electricity, what happens in Texas stays in Texas,\" said Dan Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University. \"That has really come back to bite us.\"\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nTo believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion — would have been borderline irrational.\n\n— US District Court Judge Jesse Furman\n\nCiti just lost a bid to fix a major oopsie. Last year, the bank fat-fingered $900 million to lenders for cosmetics company Revlon. Some lenders returned the erroneous funds, but others refused, prompting Citi to sue to recover half a billion dollars. On Tuesday, a federal judge said — and I'm paraphrasing here — lol no.\n\nTHE FOOD BUSINESS\n\nMcDonald's\n\nBIG CHICKEN\n\nAnother day, another escalation of the Chicken Sandwich Wars. At this point, you gotta do something special to make your sandwich stand out, so McDonald's is building buzz for its three new chickie sammies with a limited edition $5 swag bundle, which includes a hoodie, a vinyl recording of a custom song and, of course, a sandwich. (The star has got to be the hoodie, which comes in a hue that I can best describe as a \"light fried chicken color.\")\n\nBIG VEGAN\n\nNow for basically the opposite of chicken sandwiches: We have vegan KitKats now. Instead of dairy, KitKat V will use a rice-based alternative. Healthier? Nah. But more inclusive of people who eat plant-based diets? Yes!\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY\n\n$50,000\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high above $50,000 on Tuesday. That statement might have sounded like a joke a year ago, when the crypto cost $10,000. But bitcoin has skyrocketed during the pandemic thanks to rock-bottom interest rates that have severely weakened the US dollar. That makes bitcoin, a comparatively attractive currency.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS GOING ON\n\nMove over, Robinhood, here comes Goldman Sachs. The investment bank unveiled Marcus Invest, a new robo-adviser geared toward the average investor."}

Bank of Japan already ended QE. Bank of Canada shed 15% of its assets. Bank of England & Reserve Bank of Australia are tapering. Reserve Bank of New Zealand quit QE cold turkey. Riksbank will end QE this year. What's taking the Fed so long?\n\nThe ECB has increased the assets on its balance sheet by a monstrous €154 billion ($181 billion) per month so far this year via an alphabet soup of programs, blowing by even the crazed money-printers at the Fed with their average rate of $123 billion a month. While there appears to be consensus at the Fed that \"tapering\" its asset purchases will begin this year and will be completed in the first half next year, with assets then remaining level, the ECB announced today that it will start tapering its asset purchases now.\n\nAnd thereby it is way behind the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and the Reserve Bank of Australia. But ahead of the Fed.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Bank of England, which had denied in May that its tapering was tapering, and in the footsteps of the Bank of Canada, which had denied last October that its tapering was tapering – though it has since then cut QE to nearly nothing and shed 15% of its assets – ECB President Christine Lagarde also denied at the press conference today that tapering was tapering, and stressed that tapering was instead a \"recalibration\" of QE.\n\nMarkets eagerly swallow these taper denials hook, line, and sinker. Anything but tapering.\n\nIn the press release, the ECB said that the pace of net asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) would be \"moderately lower.\" PEPP is the biggie in the alphabet soup of programs, running at about €80 billion ($95 billion) per month recently.\n\nThe ECB didn't specify by how much it would reduce its purchases under PEPP, but said that it would \"purchase flexibly according to market conditions.\"\n\nThe asset purchases under PEPP will continue in diminished form \"at least\" until March 2022. After that, the balance would be level \"at least\" until the end of 2023, before the \"roll-off\" of those bonds might begin. The roll-off means that bonds mature and roll off the balance sheet when they're redeemed and would not be replaced with new purchases. This has the effect of reducing the bond portfolio over time as bonds mature.\n\nThe other programs would go on as before.\n\nThe Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III) will continue. These are loans to Eurozone banks, now with a balance of €2.2 trillion.\n\nThe Asset Purchase Program (APP), the now relatively small classic QE program that existed before the pandemic and includes sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, covered bonds, and asset-backed securities, would continue at a monthly rate of €20 billion and would \"end shortly before\" the ECB starts raising its interest rates.\n\nThis is in line with the consensus among central banks, confirmed by the Fed, that QE needs to end before interest rates can be hiked, on the rationale that QE pushes down long-term rates, while raising policy rates pushes up short-term rates, which would wreak havoc on the yield curve."}

The documents – released by New York Attorney General Letitia James after an investigation into the governor – showed that Chris Cuomo, while working as one of CNN's top anchors, was also effectively working as an unpaid aide to the governor.\n\nThe cozy and improper nature of the relationship was conveyed through text messages obtained by James' office. The texts between the anchor and several aides and allies of the governor revealed that Chris Cuomo sought to use his connections in the press to help prepare Andrew Cuomo's team as accusers started to make their stories public.\n\nOn the day his brother resigned, back in August, Chris Cuomo told viewers that \"this situation is unlike anything I could have imagined.\""}

His resignation meant he avoided a likely impeachment trial.\n\nChris Cuomo was suspended on Tuesday, after the release of documentation collected during James's investigation of Andrew Cuomo.\n\nThe information released by James showed how Chris Cuomo pressed sources for information on his brother's accusers, reported to the governor's staff and was active in helping shape responses to the charges.\n\nWhile Cuomo has said he never tried to influence CNN's own coverage of his brother, he told investigators about calls to other journalists to find out what information they had about some accusers.\n\nThat seemed to conflict with an on-air statement Cuomo gave on CNN following his brother's resignation in August, when he said: \"I never made calls to the press about my brother's situation.\"\n\nCuomo also said he never \"attacked, nor encouraged anyone to attack any woman who came forward\". According to email transcripts released this week, Cuomo wrote to aides \"I have a lead\" on one accuser, though it was not clear what he meant.\n\nA veteran TV executive, Shelley Ross, wrote a column for the New York Times in September saying Chris Cuomo groped her at a party 16 years ago, when they both worked for ABC News. Cuomo told the newspaper: \"I apologised to her then, and I meant it.\"\n\nCalls for CNN to fire Cuomo grew louder this week.\n\nMarissa Hoechstetter, a victims' rights advocate, tweeted: \"As a survivor who has trusted CNN with my story, it is deeply disturbing that Chris Cuomo remains employed.\n\n\"His unethical behavior – plus that of anyone giving him any info in the first place – should be disqualifying for a journalist. If they keep him on, they can't be trusted.\"\n\nCharlotte Bennett, an alleged victim of sexual misconduct by Andrew Cuomo, said: \"Just like his older brother, Chris Cuomo used his time, network and resources to help smear victims, dig up opposition research, and belittle our credible allegations.\n\n\"Anything short of firing Chris Cuomo reflects a network lacking both morals and backbone.

Right now, both men are standing in a very bright spotlight.\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo's alleged sexual harassment and abuse of power – documented in excruciating detail by NY AG Letitia James' report – is leading him down an impeachment track. Chris Cuomo's role as a member of his brother's inner circle, a role that raises serious questions about journalistic responsibilities and ethics, is also detailed in the report. Chris surely has a lot to say about his brother. But for the time being he is staying silent: He did not mention the scandal on \"Cuomo Prime Time\" Tuesday night.\n\nEveryone else is talking about it, though. The political firestorm around Governor Cuomo was the lead on all of the nightly newscasts. And CNN's coverage of the governor was scathing all afternoon and evening. In the 8pm hour, for example, \"Anderson Cooper 360\" led with the news out of New York while MSNBC and Fox went with other stories. \"It's not clear\" if he \"can do the basic function of government and governing in this state,\" Maggie Haberman said.\n\nPer Haberman's NYT colleague Katie Glueck, \"Events could move swiftly: A person familiar with the process said it could take just a month to complete the inquiry and draw up the articles of impeachment. A trial in the State Senate could begin as soon as late September or early October.\" Details here...\n\nThe CNN angle\n\nCan Chris Cuomo continue to helm his 9pm show while being connected to one of the biggest stories in politics? CNN management said yes on Tuesday by keeping him on the air. Chris started to call his show a \"Covid command center\" last week and he kept up the theme on Tuesday, leading with the Covid case surge among the unvaccinated and interviewing Jerome Adams about it.\n\nInside CNN, some staffers I spoke with were supportive of Cuomo on Tuesday, recognizing that no one chooses their family members, and that viewers expected to see him on the air for \"Prime Time,\" one of the network's highest-rated shows. Some other staffers were, as BuzzFeed News wrote, \"highly critical of the company's decision not to discipline Chris Cuomo for his role in the scandal.\"\n\nThat's because of Chris Cuomo's role advising his brother, and even collaborating with members of his brother's senior staff, as the sexual harassment charges crested earlier this year. The Washington Post reported on this in May, and CNN publicly chastised Chris for participating in calls with the governor's staffers. Chris also publicly apologized to his colleagues at the time for putting them in a \"bad spot.\""}

The network said it had reinstated a prohibition on Cuomo interviewing or doing stories about his brother that it had temporarily lifted last spring.\n\nThe brothers were both in the spotlight last March. Chris Cuomo caught COVID-19 and continued anchoring his show from his basement, while the governor dealt with New York's hellish days as the nation's early coronavirus epicenter. Andrew Cuomo's near-daily briefing was widely televised and, to some viewers, embraced as a counterpoint to those held by former President Donald Trump.\n\nNine times between March 19 and June 24, 2020, the governor appeared on his brother's show. The trash-talking and brotherly love between the two Italians from Queens was fun if occasionally cheesy, like when Chris Cuomo mocked his brother's big nose with a giant cotton swab he said would be necessary to give him a COVID-19 test.\n\n\"I found these interviews to be very entertaining, and perhaps Chris could ask questions of his brother that other people can't,\" said Roy Gutterman, a media law professor at Syracuse University. \"But from the very beginning, I thought it was wildly inappropriate.\n\n\"It's Journalism 101,\" he said. \"We tell our students you shouldn't interview your family and friends.\"\n\nThe policy avoids a conflict of interest — can one brother really be expected to ask tough questions of another? — or at the very least the appearance of one.\n\nThrough a spokeswoman, CNN said that the early months of the pandemic were an extraordinary time.\n\n\"We felt that Chris speaking with his brother about the challenges of what millions of American families were struggling with was of significant human interest,\" CNN said. \"As a result, we made an exception to a rule that we have had in place since 2013 which prevents Chris from interviewing his brother, and that rule remains in place today.\""}

The lawyers recommended Chris Cuomo's termination and CNN chief Jeff Zucker informed the anchor of the decision on Saturday.\n\n\"It goes without saying that these decisions are not easy, and there are a lot of complex factors involved,\" Zucker said in an email to CNN staff on Saturday.\n\nThe network said that \"while in the process of that review, additional information has come to light.\" CNN would not discuss that information, or characterize whether it had anything to do with his brother.\n\nCuomo issued a statement on Twitter calling the decision disappointing.\n\n\"This is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother.

Her office found Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women; the former governor resigned in August to avoid a likely impeachment trial.\n\nChris Cuomo and CNN have been under fire for months about their anchor's conduct. When it first came to light in May that the anchor had been talking to his brother's advisers, the network acknowledged that he had broken its rules but, as CNN said in a statement upon his suspension earlier this week, \"we also appreciated the unique position he was in and understood his need to put family first and job second.\"\n\nThe transcripts released by James this week revealed considerably more detail about Cuomo's involvement — conduct CNN executives admitted was a surprise even to them."}

The crisis surrounding his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, has deepened amid another accusation of sexual harassment—the third account in a span of days, this time corroborated with a photo. As such, Chris Cuomo felt the need to address the unfolding scandal on-air. \"Obviously I am aware of what is going on with my brother. And obviously I cannot cover it because he is my brother,\" the Cuomo Prime Time host said, noting that \"of course, CNN has to cover it,\" has done so \"extensively,\" and will maintain that pace as the situation develops—one pertaining to issues that Cuomo said he has \"always cared very deeply about.\" But, the host continued, \"there's a lot of news going on that matters also, so let's get after that.\"\n\nCuomo recusing himself from covering sexual harassment allegations against his brother is technically the responsible thing to do, given his obvious conflict of interest. But the statement came after Cuomo had covered his brother for months starting in the early days of New York's battle with COVID-19, and without a shred of purported objectivity. Last spring, viewers were drawn to the act that was the Cuomo brothers, boosting New York's governor to celebrity status for his relatively sane handling of the pandemic. The pairing was such a conflict of interest that, as the New York Times' Ben Smith previously reported, it required CNN to roll back a rule they'd instituted in late 2013 when an interview between the Cuomos raised similar questions about ethics. At the time, the network told the host he could no longer interview his brother on television.\n\nWhile the reversal was a questionable decision—and one CNN quickly came under fire for—allowing the brothers their recurring shtick, complete with familial banter and praise for the governor's leadership, packed an emotional punch that some, including Chris Cuomo himself, argued audiences craved in the early days of the pandemic. \"I wanted people to see that he's not just super-intense on this all the time—that he's living it with you,\" the host said on his SiriusXM radio show at the end of March, noting his brother is \"not a general\" but \"a man in full\" while also acknowledging \"there will come a time when there's an accountability measure where it will no longer make sense for it to be me\" interviewing him."}

But this time, he informed Cuomo that he had crossed a line.

Maybe,\" Cooper said when asked by Colbert if employees were made aware in a staff meeting, before quickly following up, \"No, no. Of course not. They would have a staff meeting and say like, 'Oh we're going to do this thing, but don't tell anybody'?\"\n\nWhen asked whether anyone was surprised by Cuomo's firing following a year of public discussion over the anchor's potential conflicts of interest with regards to covering his brother, Cooper responded that people were certainly surprised \"when it happened.\"\n\n\"I don't know about surprise overall but I mean, it didn't happen, and then it did happen very quickly,\" Cooper said. \"I think people were surprised the day it actually happened, when it happened.\"\n\nLater in their discussion, Colbert asked Cooper whether had spoken to any of his other colleagues at CNN, including fellow anchor Don Lemon — who both acknowledged is close to Cuomo. Cooper said that while he hadn't talked to Lemon since Cuomo's firing, the first person who reached out was Andy Cohen.\n\n\"You know, the first call after I got the news was from Andy Cohen, who was like, 'Do you think I could get that show?' I was like, 'Andy, you've got enough real estate in television,'\" Cooper said, to laughs. \"Andy believes he is fully qualified to host a presidential debate because he hosts the Housewives reunion.\"\n\nPrior to his termination, Cuomo was suspended by CNN on Nov. 30 after the New York Attorney General's office released transcripts and other documents that shed new light on his involvement with his brother's response to several sexual harassment allegations, according to a statement CNN provided to THR. During that time, a review was conducted by an outside law firm as part of a \"further evaluation of new information that came to light\" about Cuomo through the AG's investigation.\n\nAt the time CNN announced Cuomo had been terminated \"effective immediately,\" the network also revealed that \"additional information has come to light\" but offered no other details. That same Saturday, The New York Times reported that during the review, an allegation of sexual misconduct had been made against the younger Cuomo by a former junior colleague at another network, according to lawyer Debra S.

His ratings had deteriorated and his agenda-driven shtick had run its course.\n\nThere is something to be learned, however, from the Cuomo/CNN screwup, if the news industry is willing to do some soul searching on a broader scale.\n\nCuomo's departure should be viewed more generally than just an accumulation of missteps that CNN could no longer tolerate. This fiasco needs to be assessed in the context of the news profession's limitations and conventional wisdoms, which no longer serve the citizens' information needs in a democracy.\n\nJournalism has always had a casual relationship with codes of ethics, but they have been established for good reason by reputable organizations such as the Society of Professional Journalists and the Radio Television Digital News Association. CNN's management surely overlooked these standards in its handling of Cuomo, acting like it had never heard of the concept of conflict of interest.\n\nCNN looked the other way as Cuomo interviewed his brother governor multiple times during the early days of the COVID-19 story. The segments served as political PR stunts for a governor with possible presidential aspirations and a book to sell. Other segments ventured into stand-up comedy, with jokes and props about COVID-19 testing. In the midst of the national COVID-19 crisis, this demented New York \"bros\" routine was not the least bit funny. Given CNN's permission for such editorial nonsense, it is little wonder Chris Cuomo felt bulletproof, so to speak, and saw no barriers to further pushing ethical boundaries when he immersed himself in his brother's management of harassment allegations.\n\nWhile Cuomo finally paid the price for brazen ethical lapses, the news industry should consider that shenanigans similar to what put Chris Cuomo on the bus to journalism Siberia are happening elsewhere in the industry.\n\nCuomo is hardly the only \"anchor\" on cable or broadcast prone to mixing a bit of news with entertainment. He's not the only news personality getting paid mega-money to the point journalistic gumption goes out the door. He's not the only celebrity mouth who shoehorns a few facts into a conjured narrative to suit his own opinions, conveniently omitting context or details that might get in the way.\n\nThe electronic media's mishandling of countless stories has led to national confusion and cultural polarization. Stories from Waukesha to Rittenhouse to Smollett were handled not to inform the citizenry but to work them. Professional standards found in journalism codes of ethics could have helped guide the nation's news agenda, but seem instead to have no traction with the news industry's executives.\n\nThe nation's news consumers are savvy enough to know when they are being underserved. Media credibility studies underscore the public's disappointment. Only a third of Americans have any trust in political news they receive, according to Rasmussen Reports. Gallup surveys mirror that dismal result, with public confidence in media near record lows.\n\nCitizens with such low opinions of the journalism profession will either stop consuming news or rely on getting news from social media — both inadequate alternatives for a healthy democracy."}

I shouldn't have been involved on those Capitol steps,\" he said Monday.\n\nAntonio is alleged to have shouted threatening statements at police, poured water on an officer being dragged down the Capitol steps and have gotten hold of a riot shield and gas mask, according to court documents. He then briefly entered the Capitol through a shattered window and tossed broken furniture around, according to court filings.\n\nDuring an interview with the FBI, Antonio said he had witnessed the assault on DC Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone. Antonio said he had locked eyes with Fanone, who pleaded with him for help, and that he had seen \"death\" in Fanone's eyes.\n\n\"I didn't help him when I should have,\" Antonio told the agents.

Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that he will resign, relinquishing under extraordinary pressure his decade-long grip on power and heading off a potential impeachment by New York's Democratic-led legislature a week after the release of a report by the state attorney general that found he had sexually harassed 11 women.\n\n\"Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,\" Cuomo said in remarks from New York City. \"Therefore that's what I'll do.\"\n\nThe son of another three-term governor, the New York Democrat indicated his announcement would take effect in two weeks. He will hand over the reins to his deputy of seven years, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Buffalo native who is now poised to become the state's first female governor. Democratic state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins would take on the active duties of the lieutenant governor should there be a vacancy in the position. Hochul will appoint her own replacement.\n\nIn the seven days since New York state Attorney General Letitia James made her report public, Cuomo faced new and more adamant calls to step down from both state and national Democrats. He initially pushed back, seeking more time, against the advice of trusted aides but ultimately relented and decided to resign before state lawmakers could begin a process that would likely have made him the first New York governor to be impeached in more than a century.\n\nThe announcement capped a remarkable fall for the governor, who was lauded for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 only to see his administration swallowed up in scandal – over his alleged sexual misbehavior, the underreporting of nursing home deaths related to the coronavirus and his potential abuse of public resources as he wrote a book last year about the pandemic in New York.\n\nAs his handling of the pandemic came under increasing scrutiny, including through an ongoing federal inquiry, a series of reports about his personal behavior left him politically stricken. Even now, as he prepares to leave office, Cuomo could potentially face criminal charges related to the allegations against him. He is also being sued by one his accusers, former aide Lindsey Boylan.\n\nCuomo has denied all of the allegations, saying he never touched anyone inappropriately, but acknowledged that some of his behavior made others uncomfortable.\n\nHe continued to skirt the line between apology and excuses during his remarks on Tuesday, thanking the women who came forward with \"sincere\" complaints, but – as he did earlier this year – he insisted that he was, politically, the victim of evolving social norms.\n\n\"In my mind, I've never crossed the line with anyone. But I didn't realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn,\" Cuomo said. \"There are generational and cultural shifts that I just didn't fully appreciate. And I should have – no excuses.\"\n\nComing to Cuomo's defense\n\nBefore Cuomo spoke, his personal lawyer, Rita Glavin, attempted to undermine the report that doomed him during a 42-minute monologue in which she claimed that the governor had been railroaded by a \"mob mentality\" among his critics.\n\nGlavin accused James and investigators of bias and sought to chip away at each of the accusers' allegations. In some cases, she issued full denials on Cuomo's behalf. In another, Glavin sought to undermine the credibility of an accuser. She also claimed, as Cuomo did earlier this year, that a number of the women cited in the report misinterpreted his actions, which she said were innocent.\n\n\"They started with a presumption that he had done some terrible things,\" Glavin said of the attorney general's team, \"and it went from there.\"\n\nShe also addressed the allegations from a state trooper who was reportedly brought on to Cuomo's protective detail at his personal request. Glavin insisted that Cuomo had sought to add her to the group in an effort to diversify the force and denied that the governor harassed her, but then apologized on his behalf – as it was described on a PowerPoint slide – \"for anything he did that caused Trooper 1 discomfort.\"\n\n\"I think that women should be believed and they should be believed and treated fairly,\" Glavin said after cycling through accusations against Cuomo. \"I also believe that men should be believed and treated fairly.\"\n\nReacting to the governor's departure\n\nJames did not respond to Glavin's assertions or Cuomo's charge that political motivations guided many of those who sought his departure, but said the governor's resignation closed \"a sad chapter for all of New York\" with \"an important step towards justice.\"\n\n\"I thank Governor Cuomo for his contributions to our state,\" James said in a statement. \"The ascension of our Lieutenant Governor, Kathy Hochul, will help New York enter a new day. We must continue to build on the progress already made and improve the lives of New Yorkers in every corner of the state.\"\n\nStewart-Cousins, the state Senate majority leader, told CNN on Tuesday that she was unsure whether the state Assembly would follow through with its impeachment process after Cuomo's resignation.\n\n\"It's up to the Assembly whether or not they want to continue down the path,\" she said.\n\nStewart-Cousins dismissed Cuomo's criticism of the report as politically motivated and pointed to the \"evidence\" turned up by the investigators.\n\n\"We all had confidence in the AG's ability to take these women's allegations seriously,\" she said. \"We've been very clear about zero tolerance of sexual harassment in the workplace.\"\n\nIn a mark of how drastically the political winds have shifted in the aftermath of the report, New York State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs, for years one of Cuomo's closest allies, had been among those calling for him to resign. The governor had rebuffed him at first, last week, but when the announcement came on Tuesday, Jacobs in a statement did not mention the name of his longtime friend – instead focusing on the historic nature of Hochul's ascent.\n\n\"New York will finally have its first female Governor and we could not be in better hands,\" Jacobs said. Her experience at all levels of government – Town Board Member, County Clerk, Congresswoman, and Lieutenant Governor, makes her uniquely well-equipped to effectively govern the State at this time.\""}

The wife, who is vaccinated, recovered after 10 days. But her unvaccinated husband has been in the hospital for 22 days and counting.\n\n\"He's just trying so hard to get better and get home,\" Alicia Ball said about her husband, William, whose currently in an intensive care unit battling Covid-19. \"We have a lot of people praying for us.\n\n\"He means so much to our family.

He is currently not on a ventilator.\n\n\"It's real. It's devastating. ... It's been really hard,\" she said. \"I wouldn't want my worst enemy to go through this.\"\n\nBall added she and her husband were vaccine-hesitant, but she eventually got the vaccine under her doctor's care after fears regarding her asthma condition. She said she fell ill for 10 days when she contracted Covid-19 and had to visit an emergency room.\n\nAlicia Ball sits beside her husband, William, in a Mississippi hospital battling Covid-19. CNN via Skype\n\n\"But I didn't get put in here for 22 days and counting,\" she said.\n\nBall said her vaccine skepticism stemmed from not knowing just how badly the virus can affect her.\n\n\"We just didn't know the severity of the disease ... especially, this Delta variant. ... It just hadn't hit that close to home, yet,\" she said.\n\nMississippi has one of the nation's lowest vaccination rates, with 34.4% of the total population fully vaccinated, state data shows.\n\nThe state is also designated as an area with high transmission of Covid-19, according to federal health data. Over the past week, Mississippi saw 336 cases per 100,000 people, which is one of the highest rates in the US.\n\nThe Delta variant of Covid-19 has been spreading throughout the country, compounding concerns among health officials. Safety restrictions and mask guidances are making a return as cases rose by at least 10% in nearly every US state in the last week, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nThe variant spreads quicker and more easily than the first coronavirus strain and can infect fully vaccinated people whose symptoms are usually milder.\n\nBall hopes sharing her Covid-19 experience will encourage her loved ones and others to get vaccinated.\n\n\"God, I hope so. I hope it's helped our family, our church, our friends, anybody that sees this broadcast. I hope it helps. That's why I'm doing it,\" she said."}

How lucky are you?\n\nChris Cuomo: I consider myself blessed to have you in my life on and off the TV. I do think it is fundamentally dishonest of us to not tell people how completely random this moment is on TV each night. It has never been given a name until now. It has never been produced, and it has only been discouraged. But, everybody talks to us about it and now here we are with our own podcast!\n\nDon Lemon: Honestly, Chris, we're fearless in those moments because we are really vulnerable. And I think you always have my back and I know I always have yours. But that doesn't mean that it's going to be an agree-fest. Am I wrong?\n\nChris Cuomo: I think that's 100 percent accurate. What's the blessing? The blessing is that we're actually friends. A lot of stuff in the media is phony. A lot of couples that you see on news shows, they are friendly for the purpose of the show, and that's neither good nor bad. It is not the case with us.\n\nDon Lemon: What's been most interesting to me is that I've always been friends with people who are different than me. And you have the same sort of thing. All of your friends that I know, they don't really look like you. They don't really act like you. They come from different backgrounds and the same thing for me.\n\nChris Cuomo: We both have been doing this a long time and I've worked with plenty of people that I've liked but I've never spent as much time off television with somebody as you and I do together and there's a real treat in that.\n\nUnless something really crazy happens in the next 10, 15 years, I think this is the most interesting and recordable part of our professional lives. We've never seen this kind of political maelstrom and upheaval, not in our lifetimes.\n\nDon Lemon: And we'll see what happens next. They wanted a handoff. They got a handoff.\n\nAnd let me just say this: my favorite time of the day, besides the time that I spend with my fiancé and with my family, and my dog, is that moment that where you and I are about to talk to each other, and we don't know what we're going to say.\n\nChris Cuomo: Never.\n\nDon Lemon: And if we agree or disagree, we always go away at the end of our talk by saying what?\n\nChris Cuomo: I love you, D.

But the pair were rarely seen together outside of campaign seasons. In her public comments after Cuomo announced he would step down, Hochul sought to stress her distance from the tainted executive as she prepared to take the reins and launch her own bid for reelection next year.\n\nIn Hochul's first remarks as the governor-in-waiting, on August 11, she stiff-armed Cuomo, promising to ditch any of his aides \"named as doing anything unethical\" in state Attorney General Letitia James' report as part of her efforts to remake a notoriously noxious executive chamber.\n\n\"No one,\" Hochul said, \"will ever describe my administration as a toxic work environment.\"\n\nHochul's ascent coincides with the final act of Cuomo's decade-long run in charge of New York state, a period in which he ruthlessly consolidated power and become a national political star. During the first months of the coronavirus pandemic, his daily televised briefings won him the adoration of Democrats across the country, who held Cuomo up as the fact-driven antithesis of then-President Donald Trump.\n\nBut he burned out spectacularly in the months that followed, when a closer look at his handling of the crisis revealed questionable decision-making – most notably his administration's decision to send Covid-19 patients back to nursing homes – and put a spotlight on his alleged use of state resources to help in writing a triumphal memoir.\n\nBy early this year, the former governor, once believed to be ticketed for a fourth term, was facing mounting allegations of sexual misconduct, which he still denies, and a backlash over the state health department's underreporting of Covid-19-related deaths in nursing homes.\n\nFacing impeachment in the state Assembly and conviction and removal by the state Senate, Cuomo announced nearly two weeks ago that he would step down. Assembly leaders hit pause on their investigation days later but then backtracked, eventually deciding to complete a report outlining their findings. It has not yet been released.\n\nStepping out from Cuomo's long shadow and winning over leaders and lawmakers who clashed with him has been an early priority for Hochul, 62, who will immediately be faced with an onslaught of new and lingering challenges – from rising Covid-19 case rates to speeding up the dispersal of rental assistance and potentially extending the statewide eviction moratorium, which is set to expire on August 31.\n\nReinforcing old relationships and building new ones with the legislature, which was often treated scornfully by Cuomo, could be crucial to Hochul's fate – now and as the next election season comes into focus. Following through on her promise to cast out top Cuomo aides would likely be a welcome start, said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College.\n\n\"I don't think it's hard to identify the leading thugs. Everybody in Albany can name them and most of the press corps can name them. They have never been shy about making the phone calls or doing it face-to-face,\" Sherrill told CNN. \"That's got to be done.

And my point is we can't do that.\n\n\"I think these people are all kind of nice people. I think they're very naive, and they're all into language and identity. And that's all right. They're not storming the Capitol. But they're not winning elections.\"\n\nCarville's case, in short, is that the broad mainstream of the Democratic Party is letting the \"noisy\" liberals dominate what the average American – particularly those who identify as swing voters – thinks the party stands for. Calls to defund the police, pass the \"Green New Deal\" or end the detention of people coming across the US's southern border illegally are, in Carville's mind, simply not majority positions in the country. Pushing them – loudly – is, therefore, a major mistake.\n\nThere's a decent amount of polling data to back up Carville's contentions about his party.\n\nIn NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll conducted shortly after the 2018 midterm elections, a clear majority of people (52%) said they were \"against the country becoming more politically correct and upset that there are too many things people can't say anymore.\" Just 36% said that they were \"in favor of the United States becoming more politically correct and like when people are being more sensitive in their comments about others.\"\n\nA May 2021 Pew poll showed that 57% of Americans believe that \"people today are too easily offended by what others say\" while just 40% agreed that \"people should be careful what they say to avoid offending others.\"\n\nAnd even on specific issues, there's some sentiment that people believe the so-called \"woke mob\" has gone too far. In an Axios-Ipsos poll from May, 70% of Americans opposed \"the 'defund the police' movement\" while just 27% supported it. A May Fox News poll showed that 47% of registered voters said the Biden administration is proposing too much of an increase in government spending, while 17% said not enough, and 33% chose just about the right amount.\n\nAnd there's no question that Republicans see the focus on \"wokeness\" as a major opening for them in 2022.\n\n\"Americans do not support the woke left,\" former President Donald Trump said in a speech last weekend to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas. \"The people are with us.

And he was determined to stay on TV this year despite a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations against his brother, which culminated in the governor's resignation three months ago.\n\nBut new documents released on Monday showed that the veteran journalist was more intimately involved than previously known in shaping his brother's defense.\n\n\"The New York Attorney General's office released transcripts and exhibits Monday that shed new light on Chris Cuomo's involvement in his brother's defense,\" a CNN spokesperson said Tuesday evening. \"The documents, which we were not privy to before their public release, raise serious questions.\"\n\n\"When Chris admitted to us that he had offered advice to his brother's staff, he broke our rules and we acknowledged that publicly,\" the spokesperson continued. \"But we also appreciated the unique position he was in and understood his need to put family first and job second.\"\n\n\"However, these documents point to a greater level of involvement in his brother's efforts than we previously knew,\" the spokesperson added. \"As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation.\"\n\nThe spokesperson did not share any further details, but it's possible that Cuomo will remain on the bench for weeks.\n\nThe anchorman declined to comment on Tuesday night, but he took to his radio show Wednesday to address the suspension.\n\n\"It hurts to even say it. It's embarrassing,\" he said on his SiriusXM show. \"But I understand it.\"\n\nChris Cuomo said that he never wanted to \"compromise any of my colleagues\" and said he will respect the process evaluating his conduct. He added he will refrain from talking about the issue further.\n\nThe suspension came after significant criticism from people who noted that Cuomo had violated widely accepted journalistic norms. Inside CNN, some staffers expressed dismay about the anchor's conduct. Charlotte Bennett, a former aide to Andrew Cuomo who came forward in February to accuse him of sexual harassment, called for CNN to \"immediately take action.\"\n\n\"Anything short of firing Chris Cuomo reflects a network lacking both morals and a backbone,\" Bennett said in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nThe \"Cuomo Prime Time\" team had been planning for Tuesday's broadcast up until the suspension announcement around 6:15 p.m. Eastern, a person familiar with the matter said. Cooper's team was also blindsided by the news and left scrambling to fill the extra hour.\n\nAfter the news was made public, an emotional Chris Cuomo met with the show's staff.\n\nWhile many media critics said the suspension was necessary, some viewers expressed disappointment that he was taken off the air.\n\nCNN has not said what will fill the time slot while Cuomo is sidelined.\n\nThe documents released by New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday included text messages and transcripts of interviews with investigators who led the probe into allegations against the governor."}

CNN's viewership decline comes as Cuomo's big brother has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, threatening to \"ruin\" a female reporter, and covering up coronavirus nursing home deaths in the state.\n\nTIMELINE OF CUOMO SCANDALS REVEALS CNN'S INVOLVEMENT IN PUSHING GLOWING NARRATIVE OF EMBATTLED GOVERNOR\n\nCNN's \"Cuomo Prime Time\" averaged 1.31 million viewers during the week of March 15, the show's smallest total since it averaged 1.3 million viewers during the week of March 2, 2020 – days before coronavirus rocked America as the NBA shut down, actor Tom Hanks tested positive for the virus, and then-President Donald Trump addressed the nation about the virus from the Oval Office.\n\n\"Cuomo Prime Time\" finished 2020 with a yearly average of 1.8 million viewers, making it CNN's most-watched program.

Andrew Cuomo, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women.\n\nThe prime time host addressed the topic immediately at the start of his show, which airs at 9 p.m. Eastern, and just as quickly moved on.\n\nStories about the embattled governor's problems have been awkward for CNN, which allowed the two brothers to banter on the air several times last spring at the COVID-19 pandemic's start. The appearances charmed some viewers while making ethical experts queasy.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm aware of what's going on with my brother,\" Chris Cuomo said on Monday. \"Obviously, I cannot cover it because he is my brother. Now, of course CNN has to cover it. They have covered it extensively and they will continue to do so.\"\n\nHe said he cares \"profoundly\" about the issues brought up by the women who have accused his brother.\n\nBoth Andrew Cuomo, 63, and Chris, 50, are sons of the late New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat who served three terms in the 1980s and 1990s. His son is in his third term as New York's leader.\n\n\"It's the least they can do,\" said Steven Thrasher, a journalism professor at Northwestern University. With the story hot, Thrasher said it would have been wise for Chris Cuomo to step back for a few days and let someone else do his show.\n\nSince he joined the network in 2013, CNN had prevented Chris Cuomo from doing stories about his brother for basic journalism reasons: a viewer could not expect someone to report objectively about a relative.\n\nBut, starting last March, CNN suspended its rule. Chris Cuomo had caught COVID-19 and was doing shows from his basement, quarantined from his family. New York had the most cases in the nation and the governor's briefings were a daytime TV hit. CNN figured putting the familial bonds and rivalries on the air would make for colorful TV.\n\nAfter a final appearance in late June, CNN reinstated the ban.\n\n\"The situation CNN finds itself in illustrates why journalists should not deviate or make exceptions, even well-intentioned ones, from fairly well-established principles of journalistic ethics,\" said Scott Stroud, ethics director for the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nTwo women who worked in state government for Cuomo — Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett — have separately accused Cuomo of making unwanted advances. Cuomo said he's sorry if anyone \"misinterpreted\" his behavior \"as an unwanted flirtation.\" New York's attorney general was empowered Monday to choose an independent investigator to look into the cases.\n\nThen, on Monday night, The New York Times reported that a third woman said she had been made uncomfortable by Cuomo's behavior at a wedding reception.\n\nThe harassment charges were piled on top of years of stories that Cuomo had bullied people, and questions about whether a state policy toward nursing homes last spring put people in danger of catching the virus.\n\nOne of the leading critics of the governor's nursing home policies, Fox News Channel meteorologist Janice Dean, saw the deaths of her father-in-law and mother-in-law in New York facilities last spring.

Andrew Cuomo exists in political limbo – not completely written off as a spent force, but sidelined as the campaign to replace him heats up.\n\nCuomo, who for a decade ran the Empire State and its Democratic Party apparatus, left his perch in August rather than face impeachment and removal from office following an inquiry by the state attorney general's office that found he sexually harassed multiple women and oversaw a toxic workplace.\n\nHis departure capped a stunning fall from the national political stardom he achieved during the nightmarish first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020. Cuomo's handling of the crisis, lauded then, has since come under withering scrutiny.\n\nOn Monday, the state assembly released a report of its own – broader in scope than the attorney general's – which concluded there was \"overwhelming evidence that the former Governor engaged in sexual harassment\" and that Cuomo and his senior staff were \"not fully transparent regarding the number of nursing home residents who died as a result of Covid-19.\" The misleading data, the investigators said, was then used by Cuomo to burnish his image in a now infamous book, which was written and promoted with the help of government staffers, that initially stood to make him about $5 million.\n\nCuomo has denied the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, said he did not intentionally misstate the nursing home death count and insisted the book deal and publication process followed ethical norms.\n\nBut 18 months on from Democrats semi-seriously chewing over his presidential prospects, Cuomo is now the subject of a criminal complaint in connection to one of the harassment allegations and grand plans for an easy election to a fourth term in office – one more than his father, the late former Gov. Mario Cuomo – have been replaced by a grittier calculus.\n\nAnimating Cuomo's refusal to recede into retirement, or at least lay low in the aftermath of his resignation – which was ultimately prompted by a state legislature that was poised to impeach, convict and remove him from office – are twin struggles: to clear his name and, at the same time, make sure that New Yorkers do not forget it.\n\n'I don't know that he is powerful, but I think he is feared'\n\nToday, Cuomo's public voice is mostly limited to his email list and Twitter account, a running feed of broadsides by his lawyer, Rita Glavin, and spokesman Rich Azzopardi against the investigation overseen by New York Attorney General Letitia James into Cuomo's alleged sexual misconduct. Cuomo frequently retweets sympathetic opinion articles, including a Newsday op-ed from September that described his downfall as an \"Albany coup d'état.\" There's also a picture of the former governor and his dog, Captain, on a boat.\n\nFor many in New York politics, from operatives to lawmakers, Cuomo's swapping of the executive chamber for an online echo chamber has been a welcome one – and created a new dynamic they are keen to maintain."}

In a statement from CNN to Forbes, Wallace said he is \"excited to explore the world of streaming. I look forward to the new freedom and flexibility streaming affords in interviewing major figures across the news landscape—and finding new ways to tell stories.\" Fox News said they are \"extremely proud of our journalism\" and of Wallace, and Fox News Sunday will continue to be hosted by a rotation of anchors \"until a permanent host is named,\" according to the New York Times. Wallace was allegedly unhappy with Fox's airing of host Tucker Carlson's series Patriot Purge, in which interviewees spread conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol: NPR reported last month that Wallace complained to higher-ups at the network about the program, and he interviewed Rep. Liz Cheney, who rejected the claims made in the series. Wallace's Fox News colleague Bret Baier tweeted it was \"an honor to work alongside\" Wallace, though Carlson and other Fox personalities remained mum on his departure.\n\nTangent\n\nWallace's exit comes amid a flurry of high-profile media shakeups. Last month, Brian Williams announced he was leaving NBC after 28 years. Last week, CNN fired star anchor Chris Cuomo after it was revealed he aided his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, through the latter's sexual harassment scandal.\n\nKey Background\n\nWallace, 74, is the son of journalist Mike Wallace, one of the original hosts of \"60 Minutes.\" During his time on Fox, Wallace moderated two presidential debates, in 2016 and 2020. He is known for holding a hard line with interviewees and other Fox personalities, and criticizing his colleagues for being too partisan or for for going after \"the media.\" Former President Trump attacked Wallace's coverage of him often, sometimes while appearing on Fox, as some other personalities on the network were not as critical of the then-president. Wallace has said he was \"sickened\" by the Jan. 6 attack and he stopped inviting some lawmakers who challenged the election results on his show because he doesn't \"want to hear their crap.\"\n\nCrucial Quote"}

These deaths were a sore point for Cuomo, whose daily pandemic briefings last year elevated him to national prominence as a straight-talking teller of home truths. But now it turns out that the governor—while basking in media adulation as a hero of the pandemic—covered up the extent of the problem specifically because, according to reporting from the New York Post, his office didn't want President Trump to \"turn this into a giant political football\" by instructing the Department of Justice to investigate Cuomo's handling of the situation. In other words, Cuomo buried evidence and impeded a federal investigation, hoping that a new administration would leave him alone.\n\nLate last March, Cuomo's state health commissioner Howard Zucker signed a decree ordering nursing homes to admit or readmit Covid patients released from hospitals, even if they remained infectious. The decision was made when the primary fear of rising contagion was that hospital emergency rooms and intensive-care units would be overrun by the desperately sick; moving stabilized patients into care facilities appeared to be the least bad option.\n\nCuomo cannot in good faith be faulted for initially making this determination, though it allowed the virus to spread like fire throughout the state's nursing homes, infecting and killing the elderly and immune-compromised in droves. But he can be held to account for not rescinding the statewide order until May 10, well after it was obvious that hospitals were not being swamped by patients requiring intubation and that the policy was causing massive death in the nursing homes.\n\nCuomo ducked press demands for nursing-home mortality data throughout 2020, even as every other state made the information public. While New York admitted to about 7,000 nursing home deaths, informed estimates put the real count at around 12,000; the state refused to confirm the numbers. Last month, Attorney General Letitia James released a report acknowledging that the real death toll was close to 13,000. In reaction to this news, Cuomo snapped, \"Who cares? 33 [percent], 28 [percent]. Died in a hospital. Died in a nursing home. They died.\""}

Days after Cuomo signed an executive order on May 11 stopping hospitals from sending infected patients back to nursing homes and ramping up testing for staff, he appeared on his brother's show for a 25-minute sit-down that made no mention of the nursing home death toll.\n\nThere was only one mention of nursing homes during the entire interview, which was when Andrew Cuomo was boasting about the state's increased coronavirus testing capabilities and listed nursing homes and prisons among the sites that they had been administered.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO DOES PROP COMEDY WITH NY GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, FAILS TO ASK ABOUT NURSING-HOME CONTROVERSY\n\nDuring one infamous segment, the Cuomo brothers turned to physical comedy after the CNN anchor played a clip of the governor taking a coronavirus test where a nurse placed a cotton swab up his nostril.\n\n\"Is it true that this was the swab that the nurse was actually using on you?\" the primetime host asked his brother while holding a cartoonishly oversized cotton swab.\n\nHe then quickly followed by presenting him an even larger cotton swab, asking the governor if that was the one the nurse used on him.\n\nCornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson blasted CNN following the prop comedy routine by the Cuomo siblings.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO FINALLY ASKS BROTHER SOFTBALL QUESTION ON NY NURSING HOME CONTROVERSY\n\n\"CNN's coverage of Andrew Cuomo has been consistent with much of the media, focus on the glowing verbiage and ignore the catastrophic mishandling of nursing homes that led to thousands of deaths,\" Jacobson told Fox News at the time.\n\n\"This problem is compounded by a serious conflict of interest arising from the relationship between Chris Cuomo, one of CNN's highest-profile news personalities, and his brother the Governor,\" Jacobson added. \"Chris Cuomo should not be allowed to cover or comment on air about his brother, and CNN should appoint someone to monitor and review coverage of Andrew Cuomo to prevent this conflict of interest from bleeding over to other news coverage.\"\n\nDespite widespread criticism, CNN continued to allow the Cuomo brothers to chat on air. In June, CNN's Cuomo finally mentioned the nursing home controversy to his brother after ignoring it during at least 10 on-air interviews since the scandal began.\n\n\"Nursing homes. People died there, they didn't have to, it was mismanaged and the operators have been given immunity. What do you have to say about that?\" the CNN anchor asked after months of ignoring the topic.\n\n\"Several statements that are not correct, but that's OK. It's your show, you say whatever you want to say,\" Gov. Cuomo jokingly reacted.\n\nGOV. ANDREW CUOMO GETS A PASS FROM CNN ON NURSING HOME POLICY CONTROVERSY\n\nThe governor then called the nursing home deaths \"the most tragic situation\" and pointed to how there were nursing home deaths \"all across the country\" and said \"we have to figure out how to do it better the next time\" before the next virus wave occurs."}

He had been suffering from Parkinson's disease and had been treated recently for multiple myeloma, according to a Powell family spokesperson. Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that hurts the body's ability to fight infections.

Across his 35-year military career, he served two tours in Vietnam and was stationed in West Germany and South Korea.\n\nHe would go on to serve in top roles under four presidents, first as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, and then as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton, as the first African-American to hold the role. Powell then was tapped by President George W. Bush as secretary of state.\n\nPowell led the State Department during the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and favored taking military action against al Qaeda. He also supported the invasion of Iraq and appeared before the United Nations to present evidence that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The chief justification for the war in Iraq, however, rested on bad intelligence.\n\nPowell would go on to call his 2003 speech before the United Nations describing the weapons program in Iraq a \"blot\" on his record.\n\nWhile Powell served primarily Republican presidents and was floated as a possible candidate himself, he drifted away from the GOP in his later years. The retired four-star general endorsed former President Barack Obama in 2008 over Republican nominee Senator John McCain, and again in 2012. He backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, and supported Mr. Biden over former President Donald Trump in 2020, and said Mr. Trump \"lies all the time\" and was not an \"effective president.\"\n\nIn a statement Monday, Mr. Bush praised Powell as a \"great public servant\" whose counsel and experience was relied upon by presidents of both parties, and said he and former first lady Laura Bush are \"deeply saddened\" by his death."}

President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama issued long, personal statements about what Powell had meant to them. Former President George W.

And sitting Secretary of State Anthony Blinken delivered formal remarks recalling how kindly Powell had treated career diplomats and what a mentor Powell had been to many.\n\nThere was nothing from the immediate past president, Donald Trump – not even a brief, rote statement of condolence.

Only a handful – such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who angered Trump when the Kentucky Republican said Trump was morally responsible for the Jan. 6 insurrection – made more effusive remarks .\n\nThis is the new mourning in America, where even the death of a widely admired and barrier-breaking military and diplomatic leader has been reduced to a political talking point. And while the deaths of politicians have been used as partisan platforms before, Trump, experts say, has taken it to a new level.\n\n\"Their silence is a measure of their cowardice\" in failing to praise Powell along with Democrats and Republicans who are not Trump-aligned, says Mac Stipanovich, a veteran Republican political strategist in Florida who now considers himself an independent.\n\n\"They are so afraid of his MAGA myrmidons that they would rather pass up the opportunity to laud a man of the stature of Colin Powell, who richly deserves their praise, particularly in the Republican Party, than run any risk on incurring the disappointment – not even the wrath – of Donald Trump,\" Stipanovich adds."}

Colin Powell's funeral at Washington National Cathedral marked a moment of collective mourning in a deeply divided United States. Powell died on Oct. 18 at 84 from complications of covid-19, to which he was especially susceptible despite vaccination because of cancer and Parkinson's disease. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But, probably because of his and his family's wishes, Powell did not receive a state funeral, and his body did not lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. His service, although televised, was \"private\" and limited only to those invited. President Biden attended but did not speak.\n\nThis format muted some of the debates over Powell's legacy, particularly over the second Iraq War. But it also deprived the public of a chance to come together amid deep fractures centered around covid and debates over racism in America. When marked collectively, the passing of public figures has long allowed Americans to ponder their shared national values.\n\nPowell — the son of poor Jamaican immigrants who rose to become a four-star general in the U.S. Army, the youngest and first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as becoming the first Black Secretary of State under George W. Bush — is exactly the kind of figure to receive a ceremonial public funeral in the United States: a respected military leader and leading statesman with bonds across party lines.\n\nNational public mourning ceremonies date to Americans holding funeral processions all over the country after George Washington's death in 1799. Washington was not, as Congress hoped, buried beneath the U.S. Capitol, but the spontaneous mourning ceremonies, church services and commemorations (including pamphlets, embroidery and monuments) provided Americans an opportunity to join together in his honor. In the midst of the country's first era of rancorous partisan division, mourning the nation's first president struck a common note of patriotism, even among many who had bitterly opposed Washington himself as president and who reviled John Adams, his successor.\n\nBeginning with Sen. Henry Clay in 1852, presidents, members of Congress and Cabinet leaders periodically have lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Since 1865, many of those accorded this honor have lain atop a catafalque (platform) used to hold the coffin of Abraham Lincoln at the Capitol. After Lincoln lay in state, his body was transported to Illinois for burial, attended by throngs of public mourners and days of funeral rituals along the route.\n\nSuch public funerals are designed to celebrate both the dead and the American nation itself, and funerals have provided different Americans with a chance to imagine their connections to one another. No public funeral ever achieves perfect unity, but they all provide opportunities to imagine what American unity could look like, even when the visions differ.\n\nFor example, in 1874, when Sen. Charles Sumner (R-Mass.), a most hated enemy of slaveholding Southerners, died in office, he was surprisingly eulogized by Sen. Lucius Q.C. Lamar (D), a former Confederate from Mississippi, who used the occasion to try to dramatize a vision of sectional reconciliation. The former abolitionist Frederick Douglass also eulogized Sumner, but he argued that Sumner's work for Black equality must continue even if it risked keeping some White southerners alienated.\n\nWhen Douglass died in 1895, members of Congress moved to have his body honored in the Rotunda, but the speaker of the House and Southern senators blocked the motions, and Douglass's huge Washington funeral took place at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church instead. The refusal to have Douglass lie in state pointed to how official public mourning rituals were reserved for White men in the 19th century."}

I responded as politely as I could that Trump continues to heave himself almost daily into the news with false claims about a \"rigged\" presidential election and with ongoing attacks on the free press and even on members of his own party.\n\nHad I waited a few days to respond to the email, I would have included an excellent example of Trump's ongoing lack of common decency when he issued a tasteless statement following the death of statesman and trail-blazing military hero Gen. Colin Powell.\n\nPowell, 84, a longtime Republican who became a Trump critic, died Oct. 18 of COVID-19, amid a battle with cancer.\n\nShowing his usual lack of class, Trump said the following: \"Wonderful to see Colin Powell, who made big mistakes on Iraq and famously, so-called weapons of mass destruction, be treated in death so beautifully by the Fake News Media. Hope that happens to me someday. He was a classic RINO (Republican in name only), if even that, always being the first to attack other Republicans. He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!\"\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell was in stark contrast to the well-deserved praise Powell received from various political leaders, both Republicans and Democrats. Trump can hope all he wants, but he was such a horrible president I'm certain neither the legitimate news media nor historians will treat him \"beautifully\" after he dies.\n\nAlso, as he often does, Trump was really speaking about himself when he accused Powell of attacking other Republicans. Trump has trashed a long hit list of Republican leaders over the years, including former President George W. Bush, former House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump's one-time Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and his Vice President Mike Pence, who wouldn't kowtow to Trump's blatant attempt to steal the election.\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has insulted a hero. Remember when he belittled Arizona Sen. John McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam? Trump said McCain, who died in 2018, was no hero because he got captured. Remember when news outlets reported that Trump called America's heroic war dead \"losers\" and \"suckers.\"\n\nTrump is no match for Powell – intellectually, as a patriot or a human being. Powell served in the Army for 35 years. He was a Vietnam veteran, a four-star general, and the first Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He was secretary of state under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005.\n\nTrump is a draft dodger, failed businessman with multiple company bankruptcies, and a grifter who has conned millions of people into believing he is their political savior. Trump continues to collect millions of dollars in donations from supporters who believe his lies that Democrats cheated him out of the presidency. Even his statement disparaging Powell included a request for money.\n\nPowell was man enough to regret his role in the invasion of Iraq, calling it a blot on his record. He considered the weapons of mass destruction fiasco \"one of the worst intelligence failures in U.S. history.\" Contrast that to Trump's refusal to take responsibility for anything negative that occurred during his presidency, including his administration's poor handling of the COVID-19 epidemic that so far has killed 750,000 Americans."}

Powell could silence a room just by clearing his throat—and he would present the judicious view in every cabinet meeting.\n\nIn the beginning, Secretary of State Colin Powell was expected to be the star of the George W. Bush administration. Judging from polls, the former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman and victorious Gulf War strategist was more popular than Bush, and he might have been president himself. Powell could silence a room just by clearing his throat—and he would present the judicious view in every cabinet meeting.\n\nPowell, who died Monday at age 84, was heir to a treasured tradition of pragmatic internationalism harking back to his hero George C. Marshall, another ex-general who became America's top diplomat; Henry Stimson (secretary of state under Herbert Hoover and secretary of war under Franklin D. Roosevelt); and Dean Acheson, Harry Truman's secretary of state. Powell added his own strategic embellishment to this tradition. A cornerstone of what came to be known as the Powell Doctrine was that the use of U.S. military force should be astringent in the extreme. It should be mobilized only with overwhelming numbers, in situations where victory was near-certain, and where the exit strategy was clear. Powell also believed that the support of U.S. allies was critical.\n\nAs we know, this did not become the view—or the policy—of the Bush administration. Bush went in virtually the opposite direction, unilaterally invading Iraq after 9/11 on concocted evidence (Powell's worst moment in public life was presenting this evidence to the United Nations in 2003) with insufficient planning and no exit strategy in sight. The Powell Doctrine was also absent from 20 years of muddling through in Afghanistan, where there was no sense of what victory would look like.\n\nYet it appears that one of Powell's most enduring legacies will be a renewed embrace of his guiding philosophy. President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan came because, he complained, the Pentagon could give him no clear strategy for success. In attempting to regain their credibility with their civilian overlords, U.S. military officials will no doubt fall back on Powellian restraint, as a number of commentators have suggested in recent months.\n\n\"We could have avoided the expenditure of over $2 trillion dollars, the loss of the lives of more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen, as well as the tragic and humiliating disaster that is unfolding in Afghanistan if we had applied the Powell Doctrine twenty years ago,\" Richard J. Pierce Jr., a George Washington University scholar, wrote in the Hill in August.\n\nAccording to Seth Jones, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, most of the Powell Doctrine \"appears to be relevant today, including the list of questions that any U.S. policymaker needs to ask before deciding on military action.\" Still, Jones said a revived Powell Doctrine will not be sufficient by itself. \"The rules tell us whether or not to use force, not what happens over the course of a conflict,\" he said."}

Powell remained preoccupied with fixing things. The former secretary of state and four-star general tinkered endlessly in his garage — sometimes with his welder and sometimes on a succession of early Volvos, which were less complicated than the Corvette he used to whiz around the Beltway. (He took the Corvette to a track to race against Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his Stingray in the fall of 2016. \"You want a head start?\" Powell goaded Biden. \"Go ahead.\") He was a regular at the neighborhood hardware store in McLean, Va., where he rummaged through parts for his house's malfunctioning dishwasher or leaky faucets.\n\nHis plywood-and-wire fixes often left something to be desired aesthetically. But they satisfied his native frugality, his curiosity about how things worked and, perhaps above all, his compulsion to repair rather than discard what was broken. When he was fixing things, his longtime friend and deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage said, \"there was a result at the end of the day. It's why he was so happy as an Army officer: You take a platoon, and you make it better.\"\n\nAt Powell's memorial service in November, his son, Michael, recalled the time in 1982 when his father, then stationed at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, bought a pallet of defective adding machines from a government surplus auction so that he could take each of them apart and make them work again. He did not mention that his father's career at the time had hit a brick wall, after receiving a lackluster annual efficiency report. Then and later, Powell refused to blame racism for the matter, though he might have had cause to suspect it. His Jamaican parents had taught him that the way to overcome bigotry was to \"get over it and be better than them,\" as Michael Powell recently told me.\n\nHe did: A decade later, Colin Powell was a four-star general, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and arguably the most admired man in America. His swift ascent seemed to personify the military strategy that came to be known as the Powell doctrine: Establish precise goals, exhaust all diplomatic options, amass support from allies and the public, then defeat the adversary with overwhelming force.\n\nBoth the general and his doctrine became famous during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, an invasion of such brutal efficiency that it lasted all of 100 hours. The victory would not save the presidency of Powell's friend and political benefactor George H.W. Bush. Yet Powell also seemed well suited to the center-left boomer triumphalism of Bush's successor, Bill Clinton, whom Powell served for eight months of the new president's first term. After all, Powell's persona offered the tantalizing prospect of America moving past the two defining fault lines of the 1960s: race and Vietnam.\n\nAfter Powell stepped down, Republicans swooned over the idea of the Black general as their standard-bearer. He and his wife, Alma, eventually decided that a life of electoral politics would not be to their liking. But he was still the most popular political figure in America five years later, when George W. Bush, in his first cabinet appointment, named Powell secretary of state.\n\nBy the beginning of 2003, Powell was faced with a problem that seemed beyond his ability to fix: the commander in chief was determined to go to war with Iraq, hastily and with threadbare support from America's allies. Such a ground invasion flew in the face of the Powell doctrine. Alone among the members of Bush's war council, the secretary of state enumerated to the president the many things that could go disastrously wrong. Still, when Bush asked in January 2003, \"Are you with me on this?\" Powell assured him that he was.\n\n\"What choice did I have?\" Powell told me a decade and a half later. \"He's the president.\" His decision reflected a career built on prevailing from inside the system, ever aware that quitting was exactly what the critics and bigots wanted to see him do. For once, however, the supremely self-confident Powell failed to appreciate his leverage with the American public. Had he resigned in protest, the likely succession of events might well have forestalled the war.\n\n\"They call me the reluctant warrior,\" Powell told me, \"but if you want to go to war, I know how to do it.\" Bush tasked Powell not with overseeing the war but instead selling it to the public. The secretary's infamous speech to the United Nations on Feb. 5, 2003, with its multitude of claims about Saddam Hussein's illicit weapons program that would later be proved false, amounted to an indelible stain on an otherwise remarkable career of public service.\n\nPowell later matter-of-factly described the U.N. speech to his son as the biggest mistake of his career. But he refused to denigrate his former commander in chief — who, after all, had delegated the burden of that speech to the one man in America who had the credibility to deliver it."}

Powell had a net worth of $60 million at the time of his death, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. He is survived by his wife Alma Johnson, their daughters Linda and Annemarie, and son Michael.\n\nPrior to serving as Secretary of State from 2001 to 2005, Powell was the National Security Advisor. In the late '80s and early '90s, he served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The four-star general retired from the Army in 1993.\n\nApart from his income from his military career and White House offices, Powell earned income as an author and sought-after public speaker. In 1995, he received a $6 million advance for his autobiography, \"My American Journey.\"\n\nPowell also earned millions in speaking engagements. CelebrityNetWorth.com says he garnered roughly $64,000 per speech in 2000, with his rates going as high as $100,000+ for some appearances. He earned $7 million from 109 speaking engagements in 2000, the site reports.\n\nEarly Career\n\nPowell had a long and mostly illustrious career in the U.S. military, serving under several different presidents. His career began in 1972, when he served a White House Fellowship under then-President Richard Nixon, and concluded in 1993 when he retired as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military under George W. Bush.\n\n\"He was a great public servant, starting with his time as a soldier during Vietnam,\" former President George W. Bush said in a statement.\n\n\"He was such a favorite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom — twice.\"\n\nEntrepreneurial Ventures\n\nIn 2005, Powell worked with the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins as a strategic partner, says CelebrityNetWorth. After that, he served on the board of directors for Revolution Health, and as a spokesperson for the National Mentoring Month campaign.\n\nIn his post-military and post-diplomatic life, Powell merged his entrepreneurial spirit with his desire to help others in a philanthropic capacity. He founded America's Promise Alliance in 1997, which CelebrityNetWorth.com described as \"the country's biggest cross-sector alliance of non-profit organizations, businesses and government groups committed to bettering the lives of young people.\n\nSee: How Rich Is Mitch McConnell?\n\nAlso in 1997, he started the Colin L.

Bush's Middle East Wars, Dies of Cancer at 88\n\nDonald Rumsfeld, who served as the country's youngest and then oldest defense secretary and whose decades-long career was ultimately defined by his management of two deeply divisive Middle East wars under President George W. Bush, died Tuesday. He was 88.\n\nRumsfeld's family announced his death in a statement on Wednesday, saying that he was \"was surrounded by family in his beloved Taos, New Mexico.\"\n\nHe died of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, a spokesman told USA Today.\n\nA Navy man after college, Rumsfeld went on to represent his home state of Illinois in Congress from 1963 to 1969 before joining the administration of President Richard Nixon in various roles.\n\nAfter Nixon's resignation in the Watergate scandal, Rumsfeld became successor Gerald Ford's chief of staff and then secretary of defense — a position he resumed 24 years later under President Bush, where he worked with longtime friend Dick Cheney, Bush's vice president.\n\nRumsfeld's second stint as defense secretary lasted from 2001 to 2006, during which time he became the face of the administration's post-9/11 military conflicts as they ballooned in cost and death toll, without end, while the public increasingly turned against the incursions that the White House said were needed to ensure international security. (Rumsfeld continued to argue the same, years later.)\n\nDescribed alternately as garrulous and even technocratic, with a focus on how to modernize inside the sprawl of the military, Rumsfeld had a penchant for \"snowflakes\" — numerous memos on all manner of topics, big and small. (\"I don't want them to use initials that I don't understand. ... I have to ask questions about every third piece of paper I receive,\" he wrote in 2001.)\n\nAfter leaving the Bush White House, Rusmfeld released a memoir in 2011 and sat for extensive interviews for a 2014 documentary. In 2016, he helped develop a phone-based card game app.\n\nHe also started an eponymous foundation with his wife, Joyce, focused on \"encouraging leadership, public service and free political and economic systems.\"\n\nMuch of Rumsfeld's public profile in his final years was shaped by his time at the Pentagon under Bush:\n\nWhat did he make of the decisions to go to war? Of the American military's strategy and struggles in Afghanistan and Iraq? Of the administration's faulty search for weapons of mass destruction? Of the notorious reports of detainee torture and of abuses at the military prison Abu Ghraib?\n\nWas there more he would like to say?\n\nThe Rumsfeld family's statement said Wednesday that \"history may remember him for his extraordinary accomplishments over six decades of public service, but for those who knew him best and whose lives were forever changed as a result, we will remember his unwavering love for his wife Joyce, his family and friends and the integrity he brought to a life dedicated to country.\"\n\nRumsfeld, for his part, had not wavered in his work.\n\nHe wrote in his memoir: \"Knowing what we later learned and recognizing the costs, there is not a persuasive argument to be made that the United States would be in a stronger strategic position or that Iraq and the Middle East would be better off if Saddam [Hussein, the Iraqi dictator] were still in power. In short, ridding the region of Saddam's brutal regime has created a more stable and secure world.\"\n\nIn his own statement on Wednesday, President Bush, 74, described Rumsfeld as purpose-driven and big-hearted, recounting how he went to the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, in the immediate aftermath of the attack to help the survivors.\n\n\"For the next five years, he was in steady service as a wartime secretary of defense — a duty he carried out with strength, skill, and honor,\" Bush said.\n\nOf Rumsfeld, Bush said, \"He never paled before tough decisions, and never flinched from responsibility.\"\n\nThe documentarian Errol Morris, who spoke with Rumsfeld for some 33 hours for 2014's The Unknown Known, took an opposing view and found him not even indecipherable.\n\n\"I've made a whole number of movies over the years about characters that seem to be completely unaware of themselves. I suppose in English the word that we often use is 'clueless,' \" Morris told reporters at the time. \"That's the central feeling I'm left with at the end of making this movie.\""}

It embraced Trump's view instead.\n\nColin L. Powell had kept the political world guessing: Was he a Democrat or a Republican? At a packed news conference in November 1995, dominated by speculation about a presidential bid for the trailblazing four-star general, Powell delivered the big reveal: He was a Republican. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight That announcement was overshadowed by his other news, that he wouldn't seek the presidency, clearing the way for Sen. Bob Dole (Kan.) to seize the GOP nomination and removing a challenge to President Bill Clinton (D). But Powell used that very public moment to lay out his vision for the Republican Party and what the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff hoped to accomplish.\n\n\"I believe I can help the party of Lincoln move once again close to the spirit of Lincoln,\" Powell said in a tacit rebuke of GOP ideologues who opposed racial diversity and extending a welcoming hand to immigrants.\n\nHis vision for the Republican Party, however, never materialized. Instead, it swiftly and surely moved toward Donald Trump's political worldview, a party warning of immigrants replacing White Americans, one wary and sometimes mocking of international engagement and willing to embrace a populism that has divided the nation. Powell, the hero of the 1991 Persian Gulf War who once was heralded as the next Dwight D. Eisenhower, became an outlier in the party.\n\nIn 2008, he endorsed Barack Obama, the first Black president, and later backed Democratic presidential candidates, soundly rejecting Trump. In January, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, Powell said he could \"no longer call himself a Republican.\"\n\nThe divorce seemed inevitable for a never-Trumper often described as a RINO — Republican in name only — by the party faithful, some of whom had once promoted him as a possible presidential nominee, a Black Republican in a GOP struggling for diversity.\n\n\"He certainly is one of the greatest political what-ifs,\" said Douglas Heye, a former Republican National Committee communications director who served as deputy chief of staff to former House majority leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), referring to Powell's potential as a leader of a modern GOP. \"It highlights the fact that people like him were turning away in part because of some of that increased — especially racial — rhetoric that was acceptable in too many parts of the Republican Party.\""}

That was tough to watch. Poor Detective Colin Zabel, a character we had grown so fond of, took an abrupt bullet to the head in the final confrontation of episode five, with two more episodes of the series to go. Feeling gutted by his death? That's just what actor Evan Peters and series director Craig Zobel were going for.\n\nEven up to his final day of shooting, Peters was finding new ways for Colin to worm his way into our hearts. In the latest episode of our podcast Still Watching: Mare of Easttown, Peters digs into his connection to Colin, and why a certain scene left him \"hysterically sobbing\" in his director's arms.\n\nYou can listen to the entire Evan Peters interview here, and read highlights of our conversation below.\n\nWhen series creator Brad Ingelsby first conceived of Colin Zabel, he thought of the character as a brash, hotshot detective-type who, despite the secret he's holding about the case in Upper Darby, would walk into Mare's office like he owned the joint. You can see traces of that take in costume designer Meghan Kasperlik's wardrobe for the character. \"He's trying to dress to look good,\" Zobel said. \"Dark suits and stuff.\" Zobel liked the contrast: \"I thought it was a brilliant, you know, he was dressed like the guy who could do the hotshot detective, but he just wasn't.\"\n\nPeters even took pool lessons, to give that version of the character something to show off. In the end, perhaps it was a relief Zabel got an overhaul: \"Pool! I never used it, never got good at it!\"\n\nWhat Peters, Zobel, and Ingelsby landed on, instead, was a new vision for Zabel: an earnest young man caught in a state of arrested development and suffering from a crippling case of imposter syndrome. Zabel taking credit for a case he didn't actually solve, Peters said, \"was just the worst possible thing that he could do. Now he feels like a total imposter. You could play it where he's overly confident trying to make up for that. Or you could play it like he's totally insecure and has severe imposter syndrome, and has no idea what he's doing.

President George H.W. Bush made decisions as the commander in chief and delivered remarks from the White House to the American people on the war's opening night. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney advised the president on policy. Army Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf led the troops downrange. Serving as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, there was an Army Veteran advising Bush and Cheney while working with Schwartzkopf: Gen. Colin Powell.\n\nPowell was less than a year into his tour as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when Operation Desert Shield started in August 1990. Soon after, he was a key player in a war that the now 83-year-old Veteran fondly recalls during his travels downrange to visit deployed service members.\n\n\"These youngsters were great,\" the retired general said. \"These youngsters were fabulous. These youngsters wanted to do their very, very best. These youngsters trained, like you wouldn't believe to get ready for this conflict.\"\n\n'We're a family'\n\nPowell said one of his fondest memories of Desert Storm Veterans was watching an Army sergeant talking to a reporter right before the war started. Powell said the reporter approached a tank crew and asked questions to get the soldier to admit fear.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, what do you think? Are you afraid? Are you ready?' And the young man answered, 'I'm ready. Sir, we're trained. We've been working hard and I'm ready. We're ready.' He said, 'I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid because I'm with my family. This is my family. We are a family. We will do this well. We will get it done.\"\n\nPowell said 30 years later that memory still is crystal clear.\n\n\"I'll never forget that expression of what he said,\" Powell said. \"His sergeants were smiling behind him. The other soldiers were smiling and that was the attitude that we went into this conflict: we're a family. And it was not just a family of tankers. It was a family of pilots. It was a family of everybody you can name.\"\n\nBefore the war ground war started, the Vietnam Veteran traveled to 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division to speak to the soldiers. Powell commanded the brigade back in the 1970s.\n\n\"I went and talked to them,\" he said. \"It was a very moving moment for me.\"\n\nNot all moments were serious\n\nHe then went to another unit near the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait border. As he walked with troops, he saw camels nearby. He asked if the camels bothered the unit. The NCO he spoke to said the camels realized when a truck pulled up with orange mailbags, they were in for a treat.\n\n\"The camels noticed that about once every couple of days a truck would come in, and in the truck, a lot of baggage would be thrown out,\" Powell said. \"It didn't take them long to realize that when it's an orange bag, it's a mail bag. It didn't take them long to realize that when you have a mailbag and it's opened up, it has cookies because the GI's mother's sent them cookies.\"\n\nRoad to war through a fax\n\nPowell said Bush was cautious not to \"go to war just to go to war.\"\n\n\"President Bush went out of his way to see if he could not find a political solution and not just a conflict,\" Powell said.\n\nDespite serving as the senior uniformed military officer, Powell said he was reluctant to place U.S. military lives at stake unless necessary.\n\n\"I don't like war,\" he said. \"I hate war, but people thought that, you know, I was too reluctant to go to war. Well, I'll go to war when you want me to, but until we have to, let's see what we can do to solve the problem.\"\n\nHis policy to go to war as a last resort led to the media-labeled Powell Doctrine. The doctrine's principle idea is that, if there isn't a political solution, then the military should put its full weight behind the war to decisively win.\n\n\"That's what we did in Desert Storm,\" he said. \"We have to make sure that when we go to war, we go to war for the reason. We have to make sure that we've done everything we can to try not to have a war, but if one comes, fight it and fight it to the death. Fight it so they know America cannot be challenged in this way.\"\n\nWhen diplomatic efforts with Iraq failed, then it was time to send in the all-volunteer force. Because of the technology limitations, Desert Storm started over a fax machine.\n\n\"Back then, it wasn't quite the same,\" he said. \"The way General Schwarzkopf and I talked to each other quietly was with a fax machine. He had one and I had one. Our assistants had access to it and nobody else did.\"\n\nAir war softens the battlefield\n\nPowell said one of the major accomplishments of Desert Storm was sending in airpower opening night and for several weeks after."}

Bush replaced him as the United States found itself bogged down after 3-1/2 years of fighting, has died at age 88, his family said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"It is with deep sadness that we share the news of the passing of Donald Rumsfeld, an American statesman and devoted husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather,\" the statement said. \"At 88, he was surrounded by family in his beloved Taos, New Mexico.\"\n\nThe statement did not say when Rumsfeld died.\n\nRumsfeld, who ranks with Vietnam War-era defense secretary Robert McNamara as the most powerful men to hold the post, brought charisma and bombast to the Pentagon job, projecting the Bush administration's muscular approach to world affairs.\n\nWith Rumsfeld in charge, U.S. forces swiftly toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein but failed to maintain law and order in the aftermath, and Iraq descended into chaos with a bloody insurgency and violence between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims. U.S. troops remained in Iraq until 2011, long after he left his post.\n\nRumsfeld played a leading role ahead of the war in making the case to the world for the March 2003 invasion. He warned of the dangers of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no such weapons were ever discovered.\n\nOnly McNamara served as defense secretary for longer than Rumsfeld, who had two stints - from 1975 to 1977 under President Gerald Ford, for whom he also served as White House chief of staff, and from 2001 to 2006 under Bush.\n\nRumsfeld was known for imperious treatment of some military officers and members of Congress and infighting with other members of the Bush team, including Secretary of State Colin Powell. He also alienated U.S. allies in Europe.\n\nIn 2004, Bush twice refused to accept Rumsfeld's offer to resign after photos surfaced of U.S. personnel abusing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad. The scandal triggered international condemnation of the United States.\n\nThe United States faced global condemnation after the photos showed U.S. troops smiling, laughing and giving thumbs up as prisoners were forced into sexually abusive and humiliating positions including a naked human pyramid and simulated sex.

He attached to the tweet a Guardian article that made no such claim.\n\nPowell, who died this week, was the US secretary of state who privately doubted the George W. Bush administration's case for war against Iraq, but agreed to argue in the United Nations for war, citing flawed US intelligence that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction.

By the time Powell delivered the speech, he himself said years later, Bush was already determined to go to war.\n\nChallenged by others on Twitter, Samirah doubled down, blaming Israel as well for the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, and attaching a 1986 article from The New York Times revealing weapons deals between Israel and the Shah of Iran.

Rules are for suckers, unless you're the one who makes them.\n\nTake voting rights. If the goal of our democracy is to let all eligible Americans vote and for every one of those votes to count, the Freedom to Vote Act would have had a clear glide path to passage.

Joe Manchin was brought to the floor Wednesday, not for a vote but for a mere discussion, Republicans offered no help.\n\nHow far Democrats will go to pass rules that creep toward restoring parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, obliterated by the Supreme Court, is uncertain. But for anyone interested in a true representative form of government in the United States, something is needed.\n\nPower play\n\nThat's not the view of Senate Republicans, led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who understands the ruthless power game without regard to the example it sets for the next generations. From Washington, his party sees advantage in election antics in states such as Texas, where GOP-heavy leadership is greedily grabbing the two House seats delivered by an increasing and increasingly diverse electorate with one hand, and gerrymandering away minority representation with the other.\n\nAfter protests, the Republicans who control the Texas Legislature and the redistricting process have restored to Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's new district many of the Black Houston residents she currently represents. But every battle for every vote will be a tough one. Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro, who represents the San Antonio area, said the new map was \"designed to discriminate, particularly against Latinos, who are the driving force behind the state's population growth.\"\n\nAs the census counts a U.S. population growing less white, it's an existential threat to those who see resources and representation as zero-sum. Unwilling to share leadership with people who were once locked out by law, states are changing the rules of democracy, and that is not a game.\n\nTexas is not the outlier, but the leader on this kind of obstinance, passing laws to loosen gun rules and unleash poll watchers on any voter deemed suspicious, turning them into the bullies (perhaps armed) that we warn our children about. It's no longer \"Love thy neighbors,\" but snitch on them for bounty if we think they're even thinking about getting an abortion. Those new laws won't, of course, end abortion for those with the means to travel to another state; it will just drive desperate girls and women to seek desperate solutions.\n\nTexas is just one place where you can find adults yelling at and sometimes threatening schoolteachers and administrators over what is not critical race theory (and I defy any of the objectors to come up with a coherent definition). It seems what they really fear are lessons that tell the truth about America, a country with lofty promises it has not always lived up to.

I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia,\" he added, contradicting his claim to knowing nothing about the group and also giving the impression that they were lawyers bringing sex traffickers to justice instead of fringe lunatics. \"They fight it very hard.

Consciously and cynically selling the public on a new, multiracial vision of American interventionism, Weinberger led Reagan's dirty wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Here, Powell began to make his most notable impact on Defense Department policy, where he and his boss formulated the Powell-Weinberger Doctrine. The doctrine stresses that if diplomatic efforts have reached their limits, the military should use \"overwhelming force,\" restricted by clear objectives and exit strategies to maintain vital national security interests.\n\nWhen Bush Sr. was elected President, Powell was promoted to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he got his first chance to test the doctrine for himself, spearheading the U.S. invasion of Panama. Clarence Lusane, a professor at Howard University, who visited Panama shortly after the invasion, recently recounted what he saw on Democracy Now!: \"There were mass graves. There was the total destruction of neighborhoods. They bombed — these were poor neighborhoods, we should be clear. So, there were wealthy neighborhoods that were surgically missed, while they bombed neighborhoods that had not only been active, but had been — you know, very much embodied people who live there. So, it was a horrific invasion. And Powell said nothing about it.\" \"And these were Afro-Panamanians.\" Despite appeals to diplomacy, clear objectives, and exit strategies, Powell's doctrine is one extreme deadly force meant to advance America's imperial aims.\n\nPowell proved in the following years that he would violate his own doctrine if ordered to do so. No proof was more infamous than when he sold lies about Sadam Hussein's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction to the American public and the international community, drumming up support for the invasion of Iraq, a quagmire of a conflict for which the United States did not have attainable objectives nor a clear exit strategy. Here lies the heart of Colin Powell's lasting legacy in the world. The incalculably horrendous endeavor, which, by the lowest estimates, killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, was enabled by the very man whose name lines the halls of City College. No words can do justice to the pure devastation, which the United States wrought on the people of Iraq, and no convoluted excuses concerning CIA director David Tenet's last-minute introduction of false intelligence to Powell, nor apologies well past due, would stand up to the Geneva Conventions or the International Criminal Court. Colin Powell, reservations and all, went in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations and lent his credibility to the illegal invasion of Iraq. He never paid the price for it. He lived out the rest of his days peacefully, earning praise for his philanthropy. If only the people of Iraq were so lucky.\n\n\"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.\"\n\n- Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr."}

Adam Schiff, the committee chairman, in an interview on the Yahoo News \"Skullduggery\" podcast.\n\nSchiff added that, as the ranking Democrat on the intelligence panel in 2017, he was never briefed about the CIA's plans to target Assange. But he said the committee had reached out \"to the agencies\" — an apparent reference to the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) — after reading about the Yahoo News account describing deep divisions within the Trump administration, including objections from White House lawyers, over the CIA's plans for unusually aggressive measures to cripple WikiLeaks that had been proposed by then agency Director Mike Pompeo.\n\nAsked if he had received any response to the committee's inquiry, Schiff replied: \"I can't comment on what we've heard back yet.\" (Spokespeople for the CIA and ODNI declined comment.)\n\nThe disclosure by Schiff that the committee is pursuing information about the CIA's measures targeting WikiLeaks comes the day after the ACLU and more than 20 other human rights and press freedom groups wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging him to drop the criminal prosecution of Assange in light of what they called \"shocking\" reporting by Yahoo News \"on the government's conduct in this case.\"\n\nIt also comes on the eve of a critical hearing before a British appellate court in London next week over the U.S. Justice Department's appeal of a lower court judge's ruling rejecting its request to extradite Assange to the United States to face trial for publishing classified documents in violation of the World War I-era Espionage Act. The judge concluded that Assange, who is now in a British prison after spending years holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, would be at serious risk of suicide if he were incarcerated in an American prison.\n\nBut lawyers for Assange intend to raise the issue of what they view as the CIA's misconduct, arguing that returning him to a country where some top officials once plotted to kidnap him strengthens the judge's conclusions about the risk of suicide and should be an additional basis for turning down the U.S. extradition request.\n\nThe Yahoo News story, published on Sept. 26, disclosed that Pompeo, who had publicly labeled WikiLeaks a \"non-state hostile intelligence service,\" pushed for highly aggressive measures to cripple the organization, including a so-called \"snatch operation\" that would abduct Assange from the Ecuadorean Embassy. There were also discussions within the CIA about the feasibility of assassinating Assange, including tasking for options on how to do so, although those talks never materialized into an actual plan."}

Would better health advice have saved her?\n\nThe feeling of relief was immense as 58-year-old Michele Brown returned home from the vaccine centre. Her husband, Terry, 61, had taken time off from his job as a supervisor at a heavy machinery factory to drive her to her second Covid-19 vaccination at a Gateshead community centre. In the car, Michele told her partner of 40 years that she felt like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. \"She said: 'At least we've got that done,'\" Terry remembers. \"'We'll be OK.'\"\n\nIt was 28 April 2021. Michele, who had rheumatoid arthritis, an underactive thyroid and diabetes, had spent the last year and a half shielding indoors, on government advice. She was careful. She had a Covid station set up on the breakfast counter: lateral flow tests, bottles of antibacterial gel and disposable face masks. When family came to visit, a mask-wearing Michele would banish them to the furthest corner of the living room. \"We couldn't kiss her,\" remembers her daughter, Kim Brown, 41, who lives in Durham. \"She would say: 'You might have the coronies! I don't want no coronies. You're not giving me that crap.'\"\n\nAfter her vaccinations, Michele relaxed a tiny bit. She let her family visit more often, and stopped wearing a mask indoors when they did. But she still wasn't going out much: her rheumatoid arthritis made even brief excursions exhausting. Most of the time, Michele stayed home, chatting to Kim on the phone, watching TV and ordering endless packages online. By the time they arrived she rarely had a clue what was in them. When the news came on, Michele would sigh. \"She'd see the numbers go up,\" says Kim, \"and say: 'Those poor people. Those poor families.'\"\n\nMichele's family are mystified as to how she caught Covid – unless one of her rare visitors brought it into the house, or maybe it was when she went for a doctor's appointment. It doesn't really matter. When Michele became infected, it wrecked her body with brutal efficiency. Unknown to her, her immune system had been suppressed, most likely by the drugs she took to manage her arthritis, so her body had failed to mount a good response to the Covid-19 vaccine. In other words, the vaccine hadn't worked for her.\n\n\"I never heard anything like 'immunocompromised',\" says Terry, bewildered and distraught. \"We never did.\"\n\nMichele was born in 1962, in the village of Stannington, Northumberland, the eldest of seven children. Her parents split up when she was an infant. Her father eventually won custody of Michele, but at her request, left her with her grandmother Manuel, who raised her. \"She had a difficult childhood,\" says Kim. \"She swore her kids wouldn't have the same childhood. And we didn't. We had everything we wanted. Love. Affection. We didn't want for anything.\""}

They had come to hear Rennie Davis, then 32 and one of the most admired antiwar activists in the country, talk about changing the world. Davis was nothing short of a celebrity. Two years earlier, he helped organize the massive May Day protests against the Vietnam War, and in 1969, he and six men, who would come to be known as the Chicago Seven, were charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot outside the Democratic National Convention. Davis was one of only two defendants to testify during the raucous, highly publicized trial, which featured a parade of colorful characters, including an unhinged judge and the defense witnesses Allen Ginsberg and Timothy Leary.\n\nDavis was known for being even-tempered and a relentless organizer, but he combined his seriousness of purpose with charisma and an infectious optimism. While he's portrayed in the 2020 Aaron Sorkin film \"The Trial of the Chicago 7\" as a nerd who \"couldn't sell water to a thirsty man in the desert,\" as his fellow 1960s activist Frank Joyce put it to me, Davis was actually one of the antiwar movement's most captivating speakers.\n\nDavis would need those skills in Berkeley, where he had come to deliver a stunning message: Activism, he now believed, had failed to fix a broken country. The new solution — to war, poverty, racism — was spiritual enlightenment. \"I'm really blissed out with a capital 'B,'\" Davis told the crowd. \"We are operating under a new leadership, and it is divine. It's literally going to transform this planet into what we've always hoped and dreamed for.\"\n\nThe \"new leadership\" had an unlikely frontman: a car-obsessed 15-year-old Indian named Guru Maharaj Ji, dubbed the \"perfect master.\" (Writers and activists who struggled to understand his appeal preferred to call him other things, including \"the fat kid\" and \"the paunchy preadolescent mystical magnate.\") Maharaj Ji, who now goes by Prem Rawat, was one of countless gurus who gained popularity in the West at the time; the teenager's organization, called Divine Light Mission, had an estimated 50,000 followers along with hundreds of centers and ashrams across the United States. Acting as both devotee and spokesman, Davis insisted Maharaj Ji would bring peace to the world. \"God is now on this planet,\" he announced during a radio interview.\n\nDavis's message was catnip to Maharaj Ji's followers in Berkeley, who danced and placed Easter lilies next to a picture of the boy on a linen-draped altar. But then came the catcalls. \"We kept you out of jail, we came to Chicago, and now what are you doing to us?\" someone yelled at Davis. \"Kiss my lotus ass,\" another sneered. Activists with \"fury bleeding out of every wound,\" as one writer put it then, hurled tomatoes at their former idol. A homeless man — or prophet, one couldn't be sure — interrupted Davis with cheeky Buddhist riddles."}

As the nation's eyes were focused on the pipeline attack this week, another hacker group was busy targeting Washington DC police – striking at law enforcement in the American capital.\n\nBut it was the pipeline attack that had the most impact, emerging from the dark web and sending tens of thousands of Americans to panic-buy gas for their cars. The 5,500 mile-long pipeline, which carries 45% of the east coast's fuel supplies, announced on Saturday that it had been forced to shut down after attackers used the internet to seize control of the fuel-pumping operation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Colonial Pipeline said it had \"initiated the restart\" of operations, reportedly after paying a $5m ransom fee. But that didn't stop hours-long lines continuing to form at gas stations in the south-east US, as fuel began to dry up and the price of gas hit its highest point in years.\n\nA group of cybercriminals called Darkside has taken responsibility for the ransomware attack, which works by hacking into a company, or government's, network, and scrambling the data. The hacker then posts a note in the system demanding payment. If the organization pays up, the hacker hands back control.\n\n\"The analogy would be I break into your house, and once I get access to your house, I change all of the locks, and lock you out of your own house,\" said Eric Cole, author of the book Cyber Crisis and founder of the Secure Anchor cybersecurity company.\n\n\"And then I say: 'Hey, unless you give me money, I'm not going to give you the keys to your house.'\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline debacle is merely the latest in a spate of ransomware attacks, which include the targeting of a water treatment plant in Florida, and the Texas-based SolarWinds IT company.\n\nUS police forces have also been a focus. The Babuk group, another Russian cyber gang, is currently holding up the Washington DC police department, threatening to release stolen data unless law enforcement cough up an unspecified amount of money.\n\nThe Presque Isle police department was attacked in April, police in Azusa were hit in March, while the city of Baltimore suffered a costly attack in 2019.\n\nAs the number of attacks rise, Darkside has become one of the more prominent groups, and Cole said it has managed to \"commercialize cybercrime\".\n\n\"They've been in operation for over three years, they started around 2018, and they typically focus on lower end ransoms,\" he said. \"The average Darkside attack would ask for anywhere from $80,000 to $100,000 ransom, and they would typically do eight to 10 of these attacks a month, so they were bringing in about $12m a year.\n\n\"But we've noticed in the last couple of months they ​started targeting and going after bigger organizations. Colonial really shows their change in business model – where now instead of going after 12 small entities they go after one big one.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported that 26 government agencies have been hit by ransomware since the beginning of the year. The number of private companies targeted is difficult to calculate, given no company wants to reveal to the world, and to other would-be attackers, that they will pay up if compromised, but it's likely the number of reported attacks are just the \"tip of the iceberg\", one expert said.\n\nIn most cases, organizations have little option but to pay the ransom. After the city of Baltimore was attacked in May 2019, it decided not to pay the ransom of 13 bitcoins, which at the time came to roughly $91,000. It was a noble move, but not a financially successful one – Baltimore ended up spending more than $18m on recovery.\n\nThe FBI and other security experts say Darkside is made up of a group of criminals based in Russia, but little is known beyond that."}

That means it could be accessed through a password without a second step such as a text message, a common security safeguard in more recent software.\n\n\"In the case of this particular legacy VPN, it only had single-factor authentication,\" Blount said. \"It was a complicated password, I want to be clear on that. It was not a Colonial123-type password.\"\n\nThe panel was convened to examine threats to critical U.S. infrastructure and the Colonial attack, which shut key conduits delivering fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to major East Coast markets. Cyberattacks also hit U.S. meatpacking plants owned by JBS (JBSS3.SA) , showing the breadth of infrastructure facing cyber threats.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline hack demonstrated that much of the company's infrastructure remains highly vulnerable and the government and companies must work harder to prevent future hacks, senators said during the hearing.\n\nSecurity experts call the use of a single-factor login system a sign of poor cybersecurity \"hygiene.\" They recommend two-factor authentication, which requires a secondary measure like a mobile text or hardware token, and most major companies require this across all internal applications.\n\nSenators questioned Blount about the company's preparations and the timeline for responding to the ransomware attack, which shut the line for days and led to a spike in gasoline prices, panic buying and localized fuel shortages.\n\n\"I'm alarmed this breach ever occurred in the first place,\" said Senator Gary Peters, the committee's chairman. \"Make no mistake: if we do not step up our cyber security readiness, the consequences will be severe.\"\n\nThe FBI attributed the hack to a gang called DarkSide. Some senators suggested Colonial had not sufficiently consulted with the U.S. government before paying the ransom against federal guidelines.\n\nBlount said he made the decision to pay ransom and to keep the payment as confidential as possible because of concern for security.\n\n\"It was our understanding that the decision was solely ours to make about whether to pay the ransom,\" he said.\n\nBlount said Colonial did not have a plan in place to prevent a ransomware attack, but did have an emergency response plan. The company notified the FBI within hours.\n\nBlount said Colonial has invested over $200 million over the last five years in its IT systems. When pressed to answer how much Colonial has spent to keep its pipeline cyber secure, Blount repeated that amount. A company spokesperson later clarified the $200 million was for IT overall, which includes cyber security.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco urged companies to tell federal authorities whether they paid ransom to cyberattackers, information that can help investigators.\n\nBlount said even after getting the key from the hackers, the company is still recovering from the attack and is bringing back seven finance systems that have been offline since May 7.\n\nOn Monday, the Justice Department said it had recovered some $2.3 million in cryptocurrency ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline."}

It reflects a rare victory in the fight against ransomware as U.S. officials scramble to confront a rapidly accelerating threat targeting critical industries around the world.\n\n\"By going after the entire ecosystem that fuels ransomware and digital extortion attacks — including criminal proceeds in the form of digital currency — we will continue to use all of our resources to increase the cost and consequences of ransomware and other cyber-based attacks,\" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at a news conference announcing the operation.\n\nGeorgia-based Colonial Pipeline, which supplies roughly half the fuel consumed on the East Coast, temporarily shut down its operations on May 7 after a gang of cybercriminals using the DarkSide ransomware variant broke into the company's computer system. The ransomware variant used by DarkSide, which has been the subject of an FBI investigation since last year, is one of more than 100 that law enforcement officials are now scrutinizing, said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nColonial officials have said they took their pipeline system offline before the attack could spread to its operating system, and decided soon after to pay ransom of 75 bitcoin — then valued at roughly $4.4 million — in hopes of bringing itself back online as soon as it could. The company's president and chief executive, Joseph Blount, is set to testify before congressional panels this week.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Blount said he was grateful for the FBI's efforts and said holding hackers accountable and disrupting their activities \"is the best way to deter and defend against future attacks of this nature.\n\n\"The private sector also has an equally important role to play and we must continue to take cyber threats seriously and invest accordingly to harden our defenses,\" he added.\n\nCryptocurrency is favored by cybercriminals because it enables direct online payments regardless of geographical location, but in this case, the FBI was able to identify a virtual currency wallet used by the hackers and recovered the proceeds from there, said the FBI's Abbate. The Justice Department did not provide details about how the FBI had obtained a \"key\" for the specific bitcoin address, but said law enforcement had been able to track multiple transfers of the cryptocurrency."}

I will admit that I wasn't comfortable seeing money go out the door to people like this.\"\n\nCNN reported last week that Colonial Pipeline paid the ransomware group that carried out a crippling cyberattack, two sources familiar with the matter said.

And the pipeline company has previously told federal officials it wants to first complete a headquarters move to a new building — probably in November — though the spokesman, Kevin Feeney, said on Friday that it may allow a review sooner.\n\nIt's unknown whether the government-run cybersecurity assessment would have helped Colonial avert the ransomware attack that locked up some of its computer systems this month — and led the company to shut down its entire pipeline, leaving large swaths of the East Coast with fuel shortages.\n\nBut a range of current and former officials and cybersecurity experts say the company's ability to avoid a government review underscores how a voluntary, arms-length approach by federal officials over nearly two decades has left key elements of the nation's critical infrastructure at risk.\n\n\"I'm very concerned whenever I see a lack of urgency given the potential threats we face,\" said Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus. \"You're leaving so many areas exposed by not having a review — and addressing at least the vulnerabilities that you can identify.\"\n\nNow, in the attack's wake, the Department of Homeland Security, which houses the TSA, is reversing course, scrapping two decades of a voluntary regime for pipeline cybersecurity and moving for the first time to mandatory rules.\n\nBut a review of the TSA's history since it was handed oversight of pipeline security in 2001 shows a government culture of closely partnering with energy giants and industry trade groups in setting guidelines that were voluntary. No penalty resulted for a failure to obey them.\n\nUntil the validated architecture design review debuted in December 2018, the TSA had never done a detailed cybersecurity assessment of pipelines. The VADR, as it's called, was what the TSA asked Colonial to do last year. Twenty-three have occurred this year alone — despite the pandemic.\n\n\"The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving and we must adapt to address new and emerging threats,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. \"The recent ransomware attack on a major petroleum pipeline demonstrates that the cybersecurity of pipeline systems is critical to our homeland security.\"\n\nColonial spokesman Feeney said that over the past four years, the company has hired \"four leading independent firms\" to conduct \"comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessments to bolster the company's overarching security and information governance program.\"\n\nAs a result, he said, the company has boosted total information technology spending by about 50 percent since 2017.\n\nThe DHS shift in regulatory approach comes as ransomware attacks, in which hackers demand a fee to unlock computers whose data has been encrypted, are spreading from hospitals, universities and municipalities to industrial sectors out of a sense that these critical infrastructure companies will be more willing to pay to regain control of their systems. And it follows the intelligence community's public warning in 2019 that nation states had the ability to launch cyberattacks that could disrupt \"a natural gas pipeline\" for days to weeks.\n\n\"The lesson, particularly in recent months, is that we need to step up the incentives for the critical infrastructure to strengthen cybersecurity,\" said Michael Chertoff, who served as secretary of homeland security in the George W. Bush administration. \"Positive incentives are important, but sometimes you need to be mandatory.\"\n\nVoluntary vs. mandatory\n\nThe TSA was created in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to safeguard aviation, but pipelines — seen as a mode of transportation — were moved under its jurisdiction, too. And for the first half of its existence, physical security was the focus.\n\nPersonnel at the TSA's pipeline security program ensured that fences around pipeline facilities were high enough to keep out intruders. The threat of cyber-hacking was not a front-burner issue.\n\nBut by 2010, things had changed.\n\nIncreasingly, energy, oil and gas and pipeline systems were operated by automated systems that checked temperatures, pressures and flows.\n\nAnd concerns about cyberattacks grew — including at pipelines."}

The executive branch is limited in its authority to mandate long-term cyber requirements on the private sector.\n\nThe memorandum specifically addresses industrial control systems (ICS), which monitor, regulate, and automate operational technologies (OT) — a group covering hardware and software that enable functionality of infrastructure physical components, such as circuit breakers, motors, and valves. OT are prevalent throughout critical infrastructure environments, from power grids and telecommunications networks to manufacturing plants, public transportation systems, and energy pipelines.\n\nCompromised ICS/OT can allow attackers, in some cases, to cause physical damage to systems and even widespread outages. Probably the most well-known example is Stuxnet, discovered in 2010. Stuxnet targeted the ICS controlling centrifuges in Iran's Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, ultimately destroying the centrifuges and setting Iran's nuclear program back several years. Stuxnet is widely believed to have been a US-Israeli collaboration, but neither government has ever acknowledged its involvement.\n\nThe ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May illustrates a tricky problem: The convergence of traditional information technology and ICS/OT networks. In the Colonial Pipeline incident, the company preemptively shut down the pipeline's ICS/OT network to prevent attackers from traversing IT networks to the ICS network that controls pipeline operations, which could have enabled potential physical damage to the pipeline. The ransomware did not target Colonial's ICS/OT network directly, but the ICS network shutdown resulted in widespread fuel shortages up and down the East Coast that lasted for days."}

Under this model, it partnered with affiliates who launched the attacks. The affiliates received 75% to 90% of the ransom, with DarkSide keeping the remainder.\n\nSince 2019, numerous gangs have ratcheted up pressure with a technique known as \"double extortion.\" Upon entering a system, they steal sensitive data before launching ransomware that encodes the files and makes it impossible for hospitals, universities, and cities to do their daily work. If the loss of computer access is not sufficiently intimidating, they threaten to reveal confidential information, often posting samples as leverage. For instance, when the Washington, DC, police department didn't pay the $4 million ransom demanded by a gang called Babuk last month, Babuk published intelligence briefings, names of criminal suspects and witnesses, and personnel files, from medical information to polygraph test results, of officers and job candidates.\n\nDarkSide, which emerged last August, epitomized this new breed. It chose targets based on a careful financial analysis or information gleaned from corporate emails. For instance, it attacked one of Tantleff's clients during a week when the hackers knew the company would be vulnerable because it was transitioning its files to the cloud and didn't have clean backups.\n\nTo infiltrate target networks, the gang used advanced methods such as \"zero-day exploits\" that immediately take advantage of software vulnerabilities before they can be patched. Once inside, it moved swiftly, looking not only for sensitive data but also for the victim's cyber insurance policy, so it could peg its demands to the amount of coverage. After two to three days of poking around, DarkSide encrypted the files.\n\n\"They have a faster attack window,\" said Christopher Ballod, associate managing director for cyber risk at Kroll, the business investigations firm, who has advised half a dozen DarkSide victims. \"The longer you dwell in the system, the more likely you are to be caught.\"\n\nTypically, DarkSide's demands were \"on the high end of the scale,\" $5 million and up, Ballod said. One scary tactic: if publicly traded companies didn't pay the ransom, DarkSide threatened to share information stolen from them with short-sellers who would profit if the share price dropped upon publication.\n\nDarkSide's site on the dark web identified dozens of victims and described the confidential data it claimed to have filched from them. One was New Orleans law firm Stone Pigman Walther Wittmann. \"A big annoyance is what it was,\" attorney Phil Wittmann said, referring to the DarkSide attack in February. \"We paid them nothing,\" said Michael Walshe Jr., chair of the firm's management committee, declining to comment further.\n\nLast November, DarkSide adopted what is known as a \"ransomware-as-a-service\" model. Under this model, it partnered with affiliates who launched the attacks. The affiliates received 75% to 90% of the ransom, with DarkSide keeping the remainder. As this partnership suggests, the ransomware ecosystem is a distorted mirror of corporate culture, with everything from job interviews to procedures for handling disputes. After DarkSide shut down, several people who identified themselves as its affiliates complained on a dispute resolution forum that it had stiffed them. \"The target paid, but I did not receive my share,\" one wrote.\n\nTogether, DarkSide and its affiliates reportedly grossed at least $90 million. Seven of Tantleff's clients, including two companies in the energy industry, paid ransoms ranging from $1.25 million to $6 million, reflecting negotiated discounts from initial demands of $7.5 million to $30 million. His other three clients hit by DarkSide did not pay. In one of those cases, the hackers demanded $50 million. Negotiations grew acrimonious, and the two sides couldn't agree on a price."}

Jacqueline Van Ovost pointed to the Colonial Pipeline hack as an example of the \"growing threat\" of cyber attacks and said cybersecurity would be one of her top priorities as the new head of US Transportation Command.\n\n\"If you can imagine a cyber criminal ... can cause fuel prices to rise, what could a persistent threat — a persistent and very capable threat — do to our systems?\" she asked the audience at NDTA.\n\nWhile the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline did not directly assault military networks or other infrastructure, the event raised questions about the safety of networks used by commercial companies that form a key part of the Defense Department's logistics backbone.\n\nThe department relies on commercial vendors for gas, jet fuel, and the transportation of goods and people — all critical commodities for TRANSCOM, which uses military assets to move troops and supplies but also contracts directly with industry for additional airlift, sea freight transportation and other delivery services.\n\nAny disruption to the department's commercial vendors or its supply chain — or more widely, to the military's own infrastructure — could be devastating in a war, Kendall said.\n\n\"Our adversaries can be assumed to be able to disrupt our networks right now, because we have not sufficiently guarded against an attack,\" Kendall said. \"Fewer than half of trucking and logistics companies even have a chief information security officer. What does that mean for our supply chain?\"\n\nBefore being sworn in as Air Force secretary, Kendall spoke with the House Armed Services Committee's task force on supply chain resilience and tried to convey the importance of ensuring the security of the defense industrial base and logistics enterprise, he said.\n\n\"Peacetime supply chain disruptions and shortages were a problem certainly, but a manageable one,\" he said. \"Wartime disruptions and shortages, on the other hand, could be much more problematic and in fact decisive.\"\n\nThe Pentagon will need more funding in order to help mitigate current logistics vulnerabilities, Kendall said. Specifically, the military needs more weapons storage facilities and hardened fuel storage infrastructure, and it also needs to ensure that the commercial transportation industry can recruit talented employees.\n\n\"We must also acquire more resilient transportation systems of systems,\" he said. \"We know our current capabilities are vulnerable to cyber and kinetic attacks. We must address that harsh reality by incorporating the certainties of offensive cyber and kinetic attacks into our military requirements and into our acquisition plans.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's nominee for director of operational test and evaluation (DOT&E) also signaled on Tuesday that the department may need to do more to ensure its own weapons and equipment can stand up to cyber attacks."}

The issue was not associated with malware, the company said.\n\nThe company had earlier said shippers were having problems entering and updating nominations for deliveries.\n\nThe \"system functionality has returned to normal,\" the company said.\n\nThe reason for the network issues was not immediately clear.\n\nColonial's shipping nomination system is operated by a third party, privately-held Transport4, or T4, which handles similar logistics for other pipeline companies.\n\nT4 on Friday said its application was working for all customers and carriers. It did not comment on Colonial's current network issue and said that data between T4 and Colonial was transacting normally.\n\nFriday's network problems are the second occurrence of such issues since the attack earlier in the month. Colonial is the largest fuel system in the United States, accounting for millions of barrels of daily deliveries to the U.S. East Coast and Southeast.\n\nShortly after Colonial restored operations from the hack, it suffered a brief network outage that prevented customers from planning upcoming shipments on the line. At the time, Colonial said the disruption was caused by efforts by the company to harden its system, and was not the result of a reinfection of its network.\n\nThe southeast United States is still recovering from the six-day line outage from earlier this month and the supply issues it caused in the region. Around 6,000 gas stations were still without fuel this week, according to tracking firm GasBuddy, down from a peak of more than 16,000.\n\nAlmost 40% of gas stations in the capital, Washington, were without supplies on Thursday, GasBuddy said. More than 20% of stations in North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina were also empty."}

Posts surfaced by Zignal blamed the president for the outages, criticized his response and condemned him for canceling plans for the Keystone XL oil pipeline — though that project, which would have built a crude oil pipeline, would have had no impact on the current situation.\n\nMisleading narratives targeting Biden began picking up speed on Monday, the day North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper became the first of several governors to declare a state of emergency over the disruption.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be weird if the CYBER-ATTACK that shutdown the United States' top fuel line was an INSIDE JOB to pretend Joe Biden isn't responsible for the insane increase in gas price..\" read a widely shared tweet by former Florida congressional candidate Chuck Callesto.\n\n\"People can't complain about gas prices if there's no gas to buy,\" read the caption of an image depicting a sinister Biden with his fingers interlaced, retweeted by U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado.\n\nOther posts claimed the long gas lines across the Southeast U.S. were a harbinger of America's future under Democrats, casting Biden as a socialist in a strategy that Republicans have frequently turned to in recent years.\n\n\"Gas shortages now, food shortages tomorrow?\" tweeted Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren. \"Wow ... starting to feel like socialism is on the way....\"\n\nIn another narrative, posts equated Biden to former President Jimmy Carter who saw his presidency crumble as a result of the 1979 fuel shortage. A statement from former President Donald Trump on Wednesday, amplified by conservative websites including Breitbart News, branded a laundry list of national and global challenges as Biden's fault."}

The five plants together reportedly process 22,500 head of cattle per day. Some plants in Australia were also reportedly impacted.\n\nThe attack came just weeks after hackers targeted the Colonial Pipeline, one of the largest gas pipelines in the US, with a ransomware hack. The attack highlighted the vulnerability of the country's critical infrastructure, which has been the target of an increasing number of cyberattacks.\n\nJBS informed US officials that its servers in the US and Australia had been the victim of a ransomware attack likely launched by a criminal group based in Russia, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this month.\n\n\"Preliminary investigation results confirm that no company, customer or employee data was compromised,\" JBS said in Wednesday's statement.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the incident, and the White House is engaging with the Russian government on the matter. Biden is expected to raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their June 16 summit.\n\n\"Ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure are of an even higher order of magnitude of concern for us, whether that's about a pipeline or meat supply or a hospital system or other areas of critical infrastructure,\" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday. \"The president will talk to President Putin about our concerns on this front.\""}

Tanks are getting refilled, lines gone. Motorists are no longer panic hoarding and kicking themselves for not buying that plug-in Tesla TSLA . It may take a little longer to lose that sneaking suspicion that civilization is on shakier foundations than we thought.\n\nAnd it's cold comfort that the DarkSide hackers are \"apolitical\" and didn't intend to cause social havoc, says Jonathan Reiber of AttackIQ. Because attacks like this broaden the imagination. Now that other groups see what's possible they will try the same thing — but with more malevolent intent. And they'll ask for a lot more than the $5 million that DarkSide allegedly extracted from Colonial.\n\n\"Five million is nothing to them,\" agrees Mark Ostrowski, head of engineering at CheckPoint, who was impressed by reports that Colonial had backups from which it was able to recover the 100 gigabytes of exfiltrated data more quickly than by decrypting with the hackers' recovery key. Indeed \"five million is not a lot given the damage to reputation and productivity that was caused,\" says James Reynolds, chief product officer at SecureAge. \"They could have easily required 10 times that.\"\n\nAnd Colonial could have paid it. According to financial results filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Colonial Pipeline Company has $3.1 billion of assets (against $2.6 billion of long-term debt) and generated net income of $420 million last year on $1.3 billion of revenues. Over just the past two years the company has distributed $820 million in dividends to its owners, including Koch Capital Investments, Shell Midstream, and three institutional investors. The Koch family, led by Charles, 85, controls a 28% stake in the pipeline company. Forbes estimates their net worth at $100 billion.\n\nThere is no amount of investment in cyber security that Colonial Pipeline cannot afford, and no excuses really for this kind of cyber breach, say experts. Indeed we've reached a point where the cost of an infrastructure giant not adequately preparing for \"black swan\" risks is often far higher to society than it is to the company that got hacked. Jennifer Bisceglie, CEO and founder of Interos marvels at the string of disasters of recent months — Solarwinds SWI , the Texas power grid collapse, the clogging of the Suez canal. \"And now I have to stay home because I can't get gas because someone hacked a pipeline,\" she says. To top it off, Chick-fil-A is suffering a sauce shortage.\n\nHow can these things be allowed to happen in our postmodern economy? Too much just-in-time interconnection, not enough attention paid to resilience, says Bisceglie. Some of the most successful attacks begin by infiltrating the person who supplies the person who supplies you — making it every company's responsibility to continuously map all their connections and proactively develop back-ups. \"Not knowing is not ok anymore. Black swans are now examples of poor planning on your part,\" she says. Interos offers clients tools for enterprise resilience, including A.I.-informed scenario planning and deep analysis of supply-chain connections.\n\nThreats have been evolving for a decade, and the industry has matured, says Jonathan Reiber of AttackIQ. Far from being just the domain of pariah states for whom the internet represents an assymetric force multiplier, hacker tools are everywhere. On the dark web you can rent denial-of-service-as-a-service.\n\nWith the exponential increase in the number of attack surfaces, the problem is only going to get worse. In the past year millions went to work from home, and now find themselves living in an online world with near-seamless connections between software apps for work, entertainment, banking, investments. \"Cyber created a world without a perimeter that is now extended into our living room,\" and interacting with us via A.I. helpers like Alexa, says Bisceglie.\n\nMark Ostrowski, head of engineering at CheckPoint Software says chief information security officers must introduce so-called \"zero-trust\" architecture — in which not even devices and actors operating within a cybersecurity perimeter are considered safe, requiring multiple login protocols for any device attempting to connect to a system. And you need a security overlay sitting in front of your digital environment that is checking every link, every email, watching how devices are talking to each other, and being constantly updated."}

The industry needs to gain greater visibility across a vast network of operational technology, or OT, and to establish next-generation information-sharing platforms, according to experts.\n\nImproving visibility into OT — the hardware and software that control infrastructure — would allow pipeline operators to respond to cyber breaches with greater precision, reducing the potential for costly supply disruptions across the nation's 2.6 million miles of oil and gas pipelines. It would also improve operators' ability to detect malicious activity and prevent an intruder from triggering a catastrophic incident.\n\nComplicating the task are legacy OT networks that defy cheap and easy fixes, as well as long-standing tension between public and private stakeholders over minimum cybersecurity requirements and the scope of information that operators should share with government.\n\nCybersecurity vulnerabilities exposed by the May attack on Colonial Pipeline Co. have spurred a new push for regulation. Industry observers, including Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Richard Glick, have long criticized the lack of minimum standards for certain cybersecurity protections. With the Colonial attack in recent memory, though, the industry and some cybersecurity experts worry that in policymakers' rush to regulate, they could impose ineffective, burdensome rules.\n\n\"Compliance does not equate to security,\" Kimberly Denbow, managing director of security and operations at the American Gas Association, said in an interview, echoing cybersecurity experts.\n\nLong impasse over regulation ends\n\nBoth Kinder Morgan Inc. and TC Energy Corp. noted their implementation of the cybersecurity framework released by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, as part of their defenses against cyberattacks. Kinder Morgan expressed confidence in its cyber incident response plan, noting that there have been no interruptions or suspensions of the company's systems due to a cyber event. Still, the operators see room for additional government involvement in the space.\n\n\"Based on our implementation of the NIST cybersecurity framework and the partnerships we have with various relevant government agencies, we would not oppose making compliance with the NIST [framework] mandatory,\" Kinder Morgan spokesperson Melissa Ruiz said. \"However, we also believe that it is part of the federal government's primary constitutional purpose to protect citizens and businesses from cyberattacks by entities affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments. The private sector can never, on its own, match the resources of state actors.\""}

As the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S., its six-day stoppage led to fuel shortages and price increases.\n\nBut how much the shutdown actually affected these outcomes is the subject of a new article titled \"The Effect of the Colonial Pipeline Shutdown on Gasoline Prices.\" It's published in Economics Letters.\n\n\"We found the resulting increase in gas prices to be far less than the media initially reported,\" said Tsvetan Tsvetanov, associate professor of economics at the University of Kansas.\n\n\"When looking at the six days from the closure to its reopening, there's barely any price effect until the very end of this period. What we really saw was delayed and persistent impacts. So when we read in the news how the problem had been solved and the pipeline's being reopened, that's actually when we truly began to feel the effect of this.\"\n\nHis article, co-written with KU doctoral student Srishti Slaria, uses daily regular gasoline price data at the city level and employs a difference-in-differences approach to address potential demand-side confounding factors. While in May, fuel prices spiked to levels that were the highest in seven years, Tsvetanov discovered the Colonial Pipeline incident only led to a 4-cents-per-gallon increase in average gasoline prices in affected areas.\n\nLaunched in 1963, the 5,550-mile pipeline is the nation's largest for refined oil products. Its two tubes can carry 3 million barrels of fuel per day between Texas and New York.\n\n\"That's basically the bulk of the supply of fuel for the East Coast and the Southeast,\" Tsvetanov said. \"Some of these 18 states have local refineries. Some can rely on imports. If they have the river or seaports, they can access that. But mostly it's the Colonial Pipeline they rely on.\"\n\nIn May, just prior to the attack, dependence on oil products was escalating.\n\n\"At the time, we were seemingly coming out of the pandemic situation,\" he said. \"The economy was growing, more jobs were being created. Those were all demand-side factors that were pushing gas prices up. So the trick is, how do you parse out what would have been happening regardless from the fact of the pipeline shock?\""}

People are driving again. People are getting on planes again. But certainly the spike that we've seen that has been driven by this cyberattack, we think that will be mitigated soon,\" she said.\n\nExperts say the shortages are primarily because of panic buying and people hoarding gasoline.\n\nThe last major cyberattack to hit the U.S. was in early 2020, when hackers believed to be linked to Russian intelligence infiltrated the Texas-based company SolarWinds. The attack sent malicious code that infected more than 18,000 private and government users of SolarWinds' software.\n\nThe problem, Croft said, is that 85% of \"critical American infrastructure\" is privately owned. Those companies are not required to disclose all cyberattacks.\n\n\"They only have to do so, for example, if social security numbers are compromised,\" she said. \"The federal government is really trying to work with these companies to provide more information about what is actually happening, and really trying to work with these companies to bolster their cyber defenses.\"\n\nShe said ransomware hacks cost American companies $20 billion last year."}

For example, a substantial amount of fuel is delivered to states in the Northeast by massive tankers.\n\nJamar Gatison, 36, was filling up his tank in Norfolk, Virginia, Wednesday before a doctor's appointment.\n\n\"I'm about to run out of gas, so I have no choice,\" the construction worker said while waiting in line at a 7-Eleven.\n\n\"I'm also an Uber Eats driver. I also need gas for that,\" said Gatison, who added he probably won't deliver food Wednesday night because he doesn't want to wait in line again while the shortage continues.\n\nIn North Carolina, more than half of gas stations were out of fuel, according to Gasbuddy.com, a technology firm that tracks real-time fuel prices across the country. Just outside Raleigh, two people were charged with assault after fighting and spitting in each other's faces while arguing over their spots in line Tuesday at a Marathon gas station, authorities said.\n\nNorth Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper urged people Wednesday to only buy gas if their tank is low, and to report any instances of price gouging.\n\n\"This news is another reason people do not need to panic buy gas right now unless they really need it,\" he tweeted after Colonial announced it was restarting the pipeline.\n\nGeorgians and Virginians were also getting squeezed, with about half of stations there out of gas, according to Gasbuddy.com.\n\nAlong the Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine through some of the most rugged and remote terrain in the Southeast, hikers depend on car and van shuttles to ferry them to and from the trail and get them back to civilization.\n\n\"If I don't have the gas, I'm not running,\" said Ron Brown of Ellijay, Georgia, who operates Ron's Appalachian Trail Shuttles and often takes hikers on hourslong trips from Atlanta's airport into the north Georgia mountains, and to and from many points along the trail.\n\nMary Goldburg, 60, of Norfolk, Virginia, waited more than 20 minutes for a slow-operating pump at a 7-Eleven to fill up her tank on Wednesday. Her job includes delivering T-shirts for events and other promotional products.\n\n\"I can't get paid until my customers get their products,\" Goldburg said.\n\nThe disruption is taking place at the time of year when Americans begin to become more mobile, especially as the nation emerges from the pandemic.\n\nFour to five cars were lined up at each pump at a Circle K in Clemmons, North Carolina. Several people said they had driven to multiple gas stations to find one that had gas. Across the street, gas stations were out of fuel.\n\nMair Martinez, who works in landscaping, was filling up his lawn equipment and truck after checking several other gas stations without luck.\n\n\"That's why we've come in today, to fill up everything,\" he said.\n\nJohnathan King, who works for an area towing company, was filling up his tow truck. He said he typically does 10 to 12 service calls a day, driving between several area cities.\n\n\"It's going to be very hard for us. Hopefully we'll be able to get through it,\" he said."}

But it's one of the first, unequivocal acknowledgements from Cyber Command since the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May that the command has targeted criminal gangs that hold the computer systems of US businesses hostage.\n\nNew comments by Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, which the New York Times reported earlier Sunday, signal that the US military's computer operatives have been increasingly willing to hack criminals, and not just state actors, who pose a threat to US critical infrastructure.\n\nSecurity agencies across the US government have ramped up their pursuit of ransomware groups after hacks brought Colonial Pipeline, a major transporter of US fuel, and a major meat processor to a standstill earlier this year. CNN reported in June that the US government had taken offensive steps in response to ransomware, including compromising and surveilling cybercriminal networks, according to sources familiar with the situation.\n\nNakasone said last month that the US government had \"conducted a surge\" against ransomware operators, including by trying to cut off the hackers' sources of funding.\n\nNakasone reiterated that message in an interview with the New York Times this weekend.\n\n\"Before, during and since, with a number of elements of our government, we have taken actions and we have imposed costs,\" Nakasone told the newspaper. \"That's an important piece that we should always be mindful of.\"\n\nThe US government counteroffensive against ransomware groups, many of which are based in Eastern Europe and Russia, has also included indicting alleged extortionists and sanctioning a cryptocurrency exchange accused of laundering money for the hackers.\n\nThe White House has tried to pressure the Russian government into cracking down on cybercriminals operating from Russian soil. It remains to be seen whether that will happen – Moscow has often turned a blind eye to hackers who do not target Russian organizations, analysts say.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will hold a video call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. The two men will discuss cybersecurity, according to the White House, six months after Biden exhorted Putin to take action against hackers during a meeting in Geneva."}

PE's pipeline purchases\n\nOn the first Friday in May, a gang of black-hat hackers operating under the ominous nom de guerre of DarkSide successfully breached the cyber defenses of Colonial Pipeline, a company that moves 100 million gallons of fuel a day through a 5,500-mile network of pipes running across the eastern half of the U.S.\n\nColonial's system went dark for several days, prompting panic buying and gasoline shortages up and down the East Coast. Operations resumed in earnest on Wednesday, but only after Colonial reportedly paid the criminals a ransom of nearly $5 million in bitcoin to regain access to its systems. No immense damage was ultimately done. But the saga was a dramatic example of the rise in frequency of such ransomware attacks across the corporate world—not to mention a pointed reminder of just how vulnerable some of our crucial infrastructure remains.\n\nIt is also a tale with ties to private equity. Back in 2010, industry powerhouse KKR acquired a 23.4% stake in Colonial Pipeline for $1.1 billion, investing jointly alongside the National Pension Service of Korea. A year later, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec—a Canadian pension fund that frequently does private equity-style deals—acquired a 16.6% stake of its own in Colonial.\n\nPrivate equity investment in the larger energy sector has been tailing off in recent years, but investments in pipeline operators and other midstream energy companies have long held a place in the industry landscape. The thesis is relatively simple. The global demand for energy continues to grow, and somebody needs to build and operate the assets to move all that energy around. Pipeline companies often ink long-term contracts that lock in fees for years to come, creating a steady and projectable stream of cash flow for investors.\n\nDuring the 2010s, PE firms averaged about 17 investments per year in oil and gas pipeline companies based in the U.S., according to PitchBook data. But activity in the space plunged last year, when the pandemic created chaos across the energy sector—chaos best demonstrated when the futures price of West Texas Intermediate crude dipped into negative territory last April. After conducting 17 pipeline deals with a combined value of $7.2 billion in 2019, private equity firms executed a mere $600 million worth of transactions last year.\n\nOver the past few years, KKR has been a particularly busy player in the pipeline space. In 2018, the firm formed a joint venture with energy company Williams to buy Discovery Midstream for $1.2 billion. A year later, it paid $385 million for a 49% stake in a midstream joint venture with SemGroup. That same year, KKR agreed to buy a 65% stake in the Coastal GasLink Pipeline project in western Canada, a controversial development that has sparked protests and condemnation from First Nations people in the region."}

Biden administration officials used the breach as an example of the need to shore up defenses against the hacking of energy hardware.\n\n\"It certainly is a reminder that we need to take a hard look at how we need to harden our necessary infrastructure, and that includes cyber threats,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order Wednesday to update the federal government's approach to cybersecurity. Among several steps, the order directs the heads of federal agencies to develop plans for cloud computing, calls for an assessment of federal information technology-contracting policies and moves to establish a \"cyber safety\" review board at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBefore Colonial announced the restart, Reps. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over pipelines, said Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk had briefed committee members on the hack.\n\n\"DOE is the right agency to be coordinating this government-wide effort,\" they said in a joint statement, encouraging support of a bipartisan bill from Reps. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and Bobby L. Rush, D-Ill., to defend against cyberattacks.\n\n\"It would directly help DOE respond to physical and cyber threats to our pipeline and LNG facilities, like in the case of Colonial,\" their statement about the bill said. \"This attack and ongoing outage simply underscore the vulnerabilities we have highlighted, and how crucial it is that Congress act to enhance DOE's cybersecurity authorities so that an incident like this does not happen again.\"\n\nColonial first reported the hack to the FBI rather than the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency that is charged with guarding against cyberattacks on equipment like pipelines, the head of the agency told the Senate on Tuesday. The FBI then notified CISA.\n\nThe FBI said a crime organization called DarkSide carried out the attack. Colonial shut down full operations Friday after learning of the attack, it announced Saturday. Arteries and offshoots of the main pipeline have remained running.\n\nButtigieg pitch\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Wednesday characterized fuel shortages caused by the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline system as evidence of the need for aggressive investment in the nation's infrastructure.\n\nButtigieg said the attack was \"a wake-up call\" for the country to get serious about the systems that keep it running."}

Several viewers have called in and reported struggles finding gas.\n\nThose stations who had gas -- like the Walmart on Mobile Highway -- had long lines of cars waiting to fuel up.\n\nColonial Pipeline was forced to shut down Friday after a ransomware attack. AAA says most of Florida's gas is shipped in, so the pipeline shutdown most likely won't affect local supplies. But it could still drive up prices.\n\nHowever, the Florida Department of Agriculture said Monday afternoon that the Colonial Pipeline hack is one reason for the gas shortage, while a truck driver shortage is another.\n\nThe agency added that the Pensacola fuel terminal is also to blame, saying the company didn't meet EPA standards required by May 1.\n\n\"FDACS was recently alerted to a potential disruption in the fuel supply impacting the Pensacola region,\" Nikki Fried says in a release. \"This specific disruption is due to a company servicing that area that is unable to meet EPA standards on federal gasoline requirements under the Clean Air Act, which must be met annually by May 1.

Biden said he gave Putin a list of 16 areas – mostly in critical infrastructure - that are \"off limits\" for cyber-attacks.\n\nRansomware has long posed a cybersecurity threat to companies and infrastructure, but experts say the problem has exploded in recent years. Last year was especially egregious, with ransomware victims in the US paying out nearly $350m, according to the global security group the Institute for Security and Technology – a 311% increase over 2019.\n\nThe FBI director, Christopher Wray, highlighted this startling figure at a congressional hearing. \"Ransomware alone, the total volume of amounts paid in ransomware has tripled over the last year,\" Wray said. \"We think the cyber threat is increasing almost exponentially.\"\n\nExperts attribute the surge to a number of factors, but they say one of the most critical has been the shift to remote working during the pandemic.\n\n\"When you are working from home, you are not behind the castle walls any more,\" said John Hammond, a cybersecurity researcher at the security firm Huntress. \"You are working with your own devices, away from the safe perimeter of corporate networks.\"\n\nCriminals have found an increasingly lucrative path in ransomware attacks, in which a hacker breaks into a company or government's network and seizes data or systems, demanding payment for their return. Employees on computers outside the safety of office networks face more risks. Company networks generally only allow trusted devices to connect, reducing the risk of outside actors or malware entering. They also often have stronger protections in place than the average consumer wifi network.\n\n\"The transition that we're seeing to working from home has contributed dramatically to the rise in successful ransomware attacks,\" said Israel Barak, the chief information security officer at the security firm Cybereason. \"There are a lot more open doors to access networks now that employees are working remotely.\"\n\nOne of the most consequential ransomware hacks in recent months, on the Colonial Pipeline – which shut down systems that supply 45% of the eastern United States' fuel – has now been attributed to the breach of a virtual private network, commonly used by remote employees to connect to a company system.\n\nVPNs are the most secure way for employees to connect to a corporate network from home, but they can pose their own risks if they are out of date or do not use multi-factor authentication.\n\nA spokesman for Colonial Pipeline said the VPN that was compromised was an older model and not the VPN that employees were actively using to remotely access the Colonial network.\n\nBut experts say any time employees work offsite using their own networks, risks are involved. There have been a number of documented attacks on companies carried out through VPN access since the pandemic began, including on the Japanese game developer Capcom and a European industrial firm.\n\nIn June 2020, the justice department identified a Russian ransomware group that was deliberately targeting people who work from home during the pandemic to access corporate and government networks.\n\nCorporate and government offices have a number of measures in place meant to keep bad actors out, said Joseph Carson, the chief security scientist at the cloud security firm Thycotic. That includes secure internet routers with unique passwords, firewalls that monitor incoming traffic and keep out threats, and company devices with additional security in place.\n\n\"Most of those protections are pretty much useless when the devices have been moved to the public internet,\" he said.\n\nThough not a ransomware attack, the hack of Twitter in 2020 July was more directly attributed to remote working. Hackers called several Twitter employees claiming to be IT department employees and offered to help connect through the company's virtual private network being used by employees working from home. The 17-year-old hacker behind that heist collected $117,000 in bitcoin from the attack.\n\nSecurity breaches at large have also been on the rise over the past year. The vast majority of IT teams – 82% – experienced an increase in cyber-attacks in 2020, according to a survey from security firm Sophos."}

But last month the cybersecurity expert found herself joining the long lines of cars across the east coast of the US looking for fuel after the latest in a series of cyber-attacks had shut down the pipeline that provides fuel to 45% of the region.\n\n\"The last time I did that was in the Iran crisis,\" she said. \"My dad had to wait with me.\"\n\nThe hack of the Colonial Pipeline was just one of a series of cyber-attacks that have hit the US and elsewhere recently. Hackers have taken down JBS, the world's largest meat processor, disrupting the global meat market, closed schools in Iowa and hit hospitals in Ireland in what experts say is a dangerous escalation of a crime wave that has swelled from the small-scale blackmail operations of a few years ago to major assaults that threaten the livelihoods – and potentially lives – of millions.\n\nMany of the recent attacks have been sourced to operations in Russia and US officials say that Russia's responsibility for ransomware attacks carried out from its territory would be a central issue when Joe Biden meets Vladimir Putin in Geneva next Wednesday.\n\n\"One of the things that President Biden will make clear to President Putin, when he sees him, is that states cannot be in the business of harboring those who are engaged in these kinds of attacks,\" the secretary of state, Tony Blinken, told Congress this week.\n\nEric Green, the senior director for Russia and central Asia in the national security council, said that one of the expected outcomes from the Geneva summit was a routine dialogue between senior US and Russian officials aimed at bringing greater stability and predictability to the relationship. One of the issues in the dialogue would be ransomware attacks.\n\n\"When we talk about strategic stability cyber will also certainly be on the agenda,\" Green said in a recent discussion organised by the Centre for a New American Security. \"The recent ransomware attacks remind us that the cyber domain is prone to misperceptions and that there are dangerous escalation risks.\"\n\nUS officials say America will be pushing for Nato to expand its involvement in cyberdefence at the alliance summit in Brussels. But the unanswered question is how to respond to ransomware attacks by criminal groups for whom their host countries deny responsibility.\n\n\"Putin will deny interfering in US politics or conducting cyber-attacks, asserting that Washington has no proof, while rejecting the legitimacy of US concerns about what happens within Russia,\" said Steven Pifer, former deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"Biden should not waste time arguing. He should aim instead to ensure that Putin has a clear understanding of what conduct is out of bounds.\"\n\nThe pressure for Biden to act is rising. There has been a 62% increase in ransomware globally since 2019, and 158% spike in North America, according to the 2021 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report. Alongside that rise, the nature of the crimes and their targets are also changing.\n\n\"We are seeing more attacks, more sophisticated attacks, bigger attacks and the scary thing is we are seeing them more on supply chains,\" said Donnan. \"It used to be about financial exfiltration, stealing money, and reputational damage. It's now in a life-threatening environment. That is a dramatic change.\"\n\nNow a partner at the cybersecurity private equity investor Option3Ventures, Donnan says she doesn't expect to see any let-up in attacks. Nation states including Russia, China and North Korea are getting more ambitious in their attacks and the criminal enterprises that operate under their wings are getting more brazen.\n\n\"The landscape is ripe and ready for attack from a perfect storm of hackers, nation states and the average cybercriminal,\" she said.\n\nPart of the recent surge is down to the pandemic, which has helped the hackers by accelerating the digitization of business and giving them more access points as people and businesses have moved to work remotely.\n\nOn top of that there has been an explosion in software development, much of which was not built with security in mind from the beginning, said Donnan. \"We still have a culture of get to market, be first. We are designing code without security in mind,\" she said."}

And for the first time in seven years, the national gas price average reached $3 a gallon.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident highlights the huge fallout cyberattacks can have on the country's critical infrastructure and raises new questions about why the U.S. is so vulnerable to such crippling strikes.\n\nExperts say ransomware attacks, in particular, have been on the rise because of how easily they can be deployed, carried out by actors ranging from enemy nations to criminal gangs.\n\n\"Cybersecurity is a problem because the cyber vulnerabilities can be exploited by very small groups with small amounts of funding, it is the ultimate asymmetric threat,\" Tom Bossert, homeland security adviser under President Donald Trump told ABC News.\n\nThe FBI said Monday that ransomware from DarkSide, a criminal organization that operates in Eastern Europe, was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline network attack.\n\nWhile federal officials were still trying to determine whether a foreign nation could be involved, Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past.\n\nPrevention, Bossert said, involves remembering human beings are behind the attacks.\n\n\"We need better technical solutions on that as a group or part of a group of people trying to develop innovative solutions for better technology to prevent attacks, but there's got to be a government role in stopping the human beings that are doing the attacking,\" Bossert explained.\n\nFormer Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security Elizabeth Neumann, an ABC News contributor, said companies and governments need to keep pace with the growing security threat.\n\n\"There's a lot more we can be doing with our critical infrastructure,\" Neumann said. \"More of these systems are being digitized. Things that used to be manually operated are now being operated by computers and that of course creates vulnerability. The infrastructure in of itself is very expensive. A lot of it is decades old ... because they are so underfunded, they tend to not update their IT very often.\"\n\nNeumann said the impact of future cyberattacks could be much more severe, particularly if a foreign adversary is involved.\n\nAnother expert told ABC News that such a large-scale ransomware attack was only a matter of time, given the uptick and lack of cybersecurity coordination between private companies and the government, a key point in the executive order President Joe Biden signed Wednesday evening.\n\n\"It was inevitable that we would reach a point where one of these attacks would have significant economic damage,\" Dmitri Alperovitch, the executive chairman at Silverado Policy Accelerator and a former CTO of CrowdStrike, said.\n\nHackers can successfully infiltrate a system's computer network and deploy malicious software to effectively seize control, holding hostage files or data until a ransom is paid.\n\n\"Many of these ransom operations are more about extortion than ransomware where they will steal data -- typically emails -- and threaten their release and try to embarrass companies and hopefully find -- from their perspective -- find something that these companies will really want to keep quiet, whether it's intellectual property or information on customers,\" Alperovitch said, \"and that would increase the likelihood of actually getting ransom.\"\n\nThe boom in ransomware, he said, coincides with the boom in cryptocurrency."}

At first Darwich was skeptical of the other gas station owners who were calling him with news of a strange computer hack attack on Colonial Pipeline, the company that ran the network of fuel pipes serving much of the East Coast. The pipeline had been shut down, and panicked drivers were buying extra fuel, leading to a run on gas supplies.\n\n\"I didn't believe it,\" he said in a recent phone interview. \"There's no way in hell something like this would happen in the United States.\"\n\nBut it was true. On May 12, five days after an employee in Colonial's control room discovered the hack, Darwich's pumps ran dry. He desperately called his supplier, who told him the only thing he could do was wait. Darwich wasn't the only one who needed gas: Thousands of stations in a dozen states were in the same bind.\n\n\"For more than a month I did not see my customers,\" he said. \"It hurt a lot.\"\n\nNow he's suing Colonial Pipeline over those lost sales, accusing it of lax security. He and his lawyers are hoping to also represent the hundreds of other small gas stations that were hurt by the hack. It's just one of several class-action lawsuits that are popping up in the wake of high-profile ransomware attacks.\n\nAnother lawsuit filed against Colonial in Georgia in May seeks damages for consumers who had to pay higher gas prices. A third is in the works, with law firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith LLP pursuing a similar effort.\n\nAnd Colonial isn't the only company being sued. San Diego-based hospital system Scripps Health is facing class-action lawsuits stemming from a ransomware attack in April.\n\nCybersecurity lapses at major companies have led to class-action lawsuits and settlements in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Retailer Target paid $10 million to consumers and $39 million to banks after hackers broke into its systems and stole personal information in 2013. Home Depot brokered a similar settlement with shoppers who had their credit card information stolen from the home improvement store's computers.\n\nBut ransomware attacks have the potential to affect people in ways that go far beyond having their personal information stolen and sold online.\n\nRansomware hackers deploy software that locks the owner of the targeted computer system out of their machines, and demands a cryptocurrency payment in return for handing back control.\n\nIn a world where everything runs on computers, these attacks can cause havoc. Hospitals have had to postpone surgeries. In Southern Maryland, Leonardtown was hit by the sprawling Kaseya IT software hack and lost 17 of its 19 computers, forcing it to stop billing residents for electricity and blocking paychecks from going out to town employees. And in the case of Colonial Pipeline, hundreds of gas stations were shut down, leading to huge lines of cars waiting for what little fuel remained.\n\nThe rise in lawsuits may mean companies and organizations that are hacked are no longer just on the hook for reimbursing people who had their data stolen. They could now be liable for all kinds of damages that go well beyond a heightened risk of identity theft or credit card fraud.\n\n\"This is an extremely developing and increasing area,\" said John Yanchunis, a veteran class-action lawyer with Morgan & Morgan who worked on data breach lawsuits against Yahoo, Equifax and Target. His firm is involved in the lawsuit against Colonial that seeks to represent gas station owners."}

Rystad Energy's Oil Markets Analyst, Louise Dickson, has commented on developments:\n\n\"It's not often that hackers manage to hit such crucial oil infrastructure such as Colonial's pipelines in the US, but such an event and the associated fear of prolonged outages has taken over the psyche of traders, and oil prices are on the rise.\n\nThe malware hit the heart of the US downstream network and prices of refined products are increasing amid the disruption, causing a bullish rollover effect on crude benchmarks, with both WTI and Brent boosted in early trading.\n\nThe pipeline, which usually transports more than 2.5 million bpd of refined products from the US Gulf Coast to the Northeast, has so far pushed up prices of gasoline and diesel, as the expectation is that both will be in short supply as long as the pipeline is sidelined.\n\nSimilar to the February freeze crisis, the impacts will be localized. While northeastern and southeastern states may see increased prices at the pump, other regions with more robust products inventories, such as the US Gulf Coast, may not see the same price surge.\n\nThe other obvious upside is for European refiners, which may be able to step in and increase refined product exports to the US, though the arbitrage opportunity will likely be met by cargoes already at sea, as the two-week journey over the Atlantic at this point is still a gamble if the pipeline is swiftly restored.\n\nThe pipeline closure could also mean that US crude exports, which surged to 4.1 million bpd last week, are kept onshore and fed into domestic refineries to replenish inventories.\n\nStorage in the northeast and southeast regions of the US are poised to be heavily tapped in the coming days as the pipeline remains offline.\n\nThe bullish developments in the US are hiding a worrying Covid-19 trend in Asia. While some oil demand destruction in India is being registered and priced in, the pandemic is also hitting other southern and southeast Asian countries, where infections are on an alarming upward spiral.\n\nBefore the US pipeline hack, the worsening Covid-19 situation in Asia was set to have a bearish effect on prices and dominate the week, but now it is limiting the bullish effect of the US pipeline hack instead.\n\nIf the pipelines come back online quickly this week, the market may be in for a price correction that will make the impact of the pandemic's spread in Asia more visible."}

They were then able to shut down the servers from the inside.\n\n\"REvil...restored the infrastructure from the backups under the assumption that they had not been compromised,\" said Oleg Skulkin, an official at the Russian security company Group-IB. \"Ironically, the gang's own favorite tactic of compromising the backups was turned against them.\"\n\nReuters described REvil as \"one of the worst of dozens of ransomware gangs that work with hackers to penetrate and paralyze companies around the world.\"\n\nThe hacking of the Colonial Pipeline by REvil and another ransomware group, DarkSide, led to massive gasoline shortages and caused President Joe Biden to declare a state of emergency in 17 states.\n\nThe pipeline ended up being under siege for six days. This caused panic buying of fuel across numerous states, and The Washington Post reported that the average gallon of gas rose to its highest price since 2014.\n\nAn energy official told Politico at the time that it was the \"most significant, successful attack on energy infrastructure we know of in the United States.\"\n\nThe pipeline was eventually restored, but only after the pipeline's owner, Colonial Pipeline Company, sent REvil and DarkSide $4.4 million.\n\nREvil made headlines again in July when it hacked into software management company Kaseya, allowing the group to access the personal information of hundreds of the company's clients.\n\nThey demanded a large ransom from Kaseya as well. The FBI, however, was able to use a secret decryption key that allowed Kaseya customers to recover their stolen files.\n\nThe White House National Security Council told Reuters that they were \"undertaking a whole of government ransomware effort, including disruption of ransomware infrastructure and actors,\" but declined to comment specifically on the REvil operation.\n\nThe FBI also declined to comment on the investigation.\n\nCyberattacks have been elevated to a more serious level in recent months after U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco determined that \"ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure should be treated as a national security issue akin to terrorism.\"\n\nNewsweek contacted the U.S. Cyber Command for comment."}

One business decided not to give in to their attackers' demands.\n\nCyberattacks like the recent global attack that impacted multiple companies over the Fourth of July weekend, this spring's disruptive attack on Colonial Pipeline and 2017's infamous WannaCry virus are only growing in frequency and cost. The last five years especially has shown a marked increase, with attackers holding information and digital architecture hostage while demanding greater and greater ransoms.\n\nIn 2021, major critical infrastructure systems have become a favorite target of hacker organizations. The early May attack on Colonial Pipeline, a major oil provider on the East Coast, not only showed how brittle corporate cybersecurity standards can be, but also that integral businesses can potentially be extorted into paying ransoms. Colonial Pipeline paid the attackers $4.4 million (with much of it recovered by the U.S. government) and the incident led to widespread gas shortages.\n\nBut if a company can be hacked once, it stands to reason that they can be hacked again.\n\nWhen Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian renewable energy and aluminum manufacturing company, recently faced a ransomware attack, they handled it in a different way. They refused to pay the ransom, and took up the task of removing the virus from the equation altogether.\n\nIn March of 2019, on the day Hilde Merete Aasheim was appointed Norsk Hydro CEO, she faced a predictable day full of meetings and media interviews. The last thing she expected was a wake up call at 4 a.m. Exhausted, she answered the phone and heard what she assumed was a practical joke on the other end.\n\n\"That's normally not when you get a phone call,\" says Aasheim, who was quickly informed that day of the attack. She said her colleague on the other end of the line told her: \"We are under a severe cyber attack, you have to come to work. This is not a drill.\"\n\nThe attack against Norsk Hydro (which produces enough energy in Norway for 900,000 homes per year) affected the company's global network of over 3,000 servers and thousands more PCs, locking everyone out and encrypting key areas of the company's IT network.\n\nWithout the decryption key, (which the hackers may or may not provide after a ransomware payment) that data is virtually inaccessible. But even regaining access left Norsk Hydro with a compromised system, one receptive to another attack. The company decided it would not pay the ransom, instead opting to reach out to cybersecurity experts. \"There was never the option to pay any ransom,\" says Aasheim, who suspected the attackers would only come back for more.\n\nMeanwhile the attack's virus crippled the company's network and stalled production in all of its manufacturing facilities. Norsk Hydro made the decision to shut down access to the network, and switch over to manual operation of its most critical systems, warning employees to stay off their devices. Next came shutting down the company's own internal network to prevent propagation of the virus.\n\nWhile the benefit of a downed network means easier identification of a malicious virus (as suspicious activity is more prominent), the ramifications were costly. How do you run a manufacturing company without computers, even for more than a single day? They had to figure out how to handle it for weeks.\n\n\"It was a very special situation for many weeks before we sort of had our hands around it...and could start to identify what was really compromised,\" says Aasheim. Printed order forms, sticky notes on doors and black computer screens, hours of manual labor and extensive bookkeeping helped keep the most essential orders fulfilled. Norsk Hydro relied on pen and paper to track its manufacturing and finances for about three weeks until computer access could be restored, only partially, and for mission-critical work.\n\n\"We didn't have any orders, we didn't have anything in the computers,\" says Aasheim. Manufacturing plants had to operate without computer assistance, a difficult task when making precision aluminum components and dealing with smelters that reach 960 degrees celsius.\n\n\"That's quite a scary situation if you don't have, let's say, data to guide you how to operate,\" says Aasheim. By asking former Hydro employees and retirees familiar with the paper-based method of manufacturing to pitch in, the production facilities were able to continue to fulfill simpler orders from clients using a combination of both expertise and the few physically printed order forms and procedures for certain parts."}

L1N2MZ1WZ\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp temporarily suspended gas taxes in the state to ease the impact of the price hikes on consumers, and also asked citizens not to \"panic buy.\"\n\nJames Jones, 48, a contractor in Atlanta, did not heed that call. He drove for miles looking for a retail station that was still operating Wednesday morning so he could load up two red five-gallon jerry cans for future use.\n\n\"I just went to five stations, finally I found one that still had gas,\" Jones said.\n\nHe had filled up his Chevy truck with gasoline Tuesday night, but got nervous and decided to get more. \"Who knows when this will end, so I thought I'd better get mine,\" Jones said. \"I need to keep my truck running.\"\n\nThe attitude was similar in parts of North Carolina, where drivers were also pumping retail stations dry.\n\nCherie Thomas, a manager at an Exxon Mobil station in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for example, had a delivery of about 4,000 gallons of gasoline Wednesday morning that she said was running down fast.\n\n\"We ran out of fuel yesterday, and this will all be gone in just an hour,\" Thomas said.\n\nA line of about 30 cars snaked out of the station and into a parking lot next door as people vied for the next open pump.\n\nAsked how motorists are handling the shortage, Thomas said, \"Not very nice.\"\n\nRob Underwood, President of the Energy Marketers of America, which represents fuel distributors and gas stations, pleaded with U.S. drivers to stay calm."}

Some experts suspect that amount is low.\n\nThe attack that led Colonial Pipeline to shut down its 5,500-mile pipeline, causing fuel shortages throughout the southeastern United States, underscored that the ballooning ransomware wave isn't just about money. Targeting the private businesses that run much of the economy also threatens national security.\n\nPresident Biden on Thursday announced that the U.S. government had \"strong reason to believe\" the criminals behind the attack lived in Russia, though he said he did not believe the Russian government had directed the assault. Nonetheless, he warned Moscow about the need to \"take decisive action\" against them. The Justice Department, he said, would step up prosecutions of ransomware hackers and the government will \"pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate.\"\n\nShortly after Biden's comments, DarkSide, the hacker ring behind the Colonial strike, told its criminal partners that it had lost control of its computer servers and was shutting down.

In any case, it is unlikely to end the risk from ransomware attacks.\n\nOne thing is certain. DarkSide had a profitable quarter. The ring collected $14 million in ransoms for all of 2020 and raked in $46 million in just the first three months of this year, according to an analysis by Chainalysis.\n\nColonial told U.S. officials it was not planning to pay ransom, according to three people familiar with the matter, but one person later said the company changed course. The Washington Post previously reported that the company had no plan to pay a ransom. Industry analysts, based on circumstantial evidence in an online ledger that tracks cryptocurrency payments, say they believe Colonial made a $5 million payment. Colonial has declined to say.

Colonial shut down the system in part to ensure the ransomware would not migrate from IT systems to operational networks, which control physical assets in the field, according to U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger. She said she could not disclose whether Colonial detected malware in its operational technology, or OT.\n\nCybersecurity solutions firm Tripwire Inc. said the Colonial incident appears to be limited to IT functions, but warned that cybercriminals are increasingly targeting industrial companies and utilities because they often have limited visibility into OT devices on their industrial network. \"Here we saw the direct impact of an IT event on OT systems, which reinforces the importance of maintaining visibility of assets across your entire network,\" Tripwire Vice President for Industrial Sales Alex Bagwell said in a May 11 blog post.\n\nVisibility entails creating a picture of the relationship between physical and digital worlds that allows companies to immediately identify which assets are associated with an anomaly once it is detected, according to Leo Simonovich, vice president and global head of industrial cyber and digital security at Siemens Energy AG.\n\nThat could in turn allow a more precise response to attacks, he added. Simonovich noted that the Colonial cyberattack has one thing in common with a previous attack that shut a gas pipeline system: Both companies took the blunt approach of shuttering a whole system."}

Ransomware gangs were shockingly aggressive, targeting health care facilities, schools, and critical infrastructure at an alarming rate. And hackers continued to launch supply chain attacks with extensive fallout. With the pandemic still raging in the background, system administrators, incident responders, global law enforcement, and security practitioners of all sorts worked tirelessly to counter the barrage. And governments scrambled to take more concrete action against online threats.\n\nFor now, though, the seemingly endless cat-and-mouse game continues. As John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, puts it, \"2021 is the year where we're realizing that the problems we chose not to solve years or decades ago are one by one coming back to haunt us.\"\n\nHere's WIRED's retrospective on the year's worst breaches, leaks, data exposures, ransomware attacks, state-sponsored hacking campaigns, and digital mayhem. With no sign of a reprieve in 2022, watch your back and stay safe out there.\n\nIn early May, ransomware hit Colonial Pipeline, which operates a 5,500-mile pipeline that carries nearly half of the East Coast's fuel—gasoline, diesel, and natural gas—from Texas all the way to New Jersey. As a result of the attack, the company shut down portions of the pipeline both to contain the malware and because the attack knocked its billing systems offline. As lines grew at gas stations through the southeastern US, the Department of Transportation released an emergency order to allow expanded fuel distribution by truck. The FBI also named the notorious Russia-linked ransomware gang DarkSide as the perpetrator of the attack.\n\nColonial Pipelines paid a 75 bitcoin ransom—worth more than $4 million at the time—in an attempt to resolve the incident. Law enforcement was later able to recover some of the funds, and DarkSide went underground to avoid scrutiny. In November, the State Department announced a $10 million bounty for substantive information about the group's ringleaders. The attack was one of the largest-ever disruptions of US critical infrastructure by hackers, and was part of a series of alarming hacks in 2021 that finally seem to have served as a wakeup call for the US government and its allies about the need to comprehensively address and deter ransomware attacks."}

And lumber shortages — which existed during former President Donald Trump's administration — were worsened by an unexpected housing boom.\n\nShortages have bedeviled the economy this spring, but most economists attribute the bulk of them to the difficulties of restarting the U.S. and global economies.\n\nA look at the claims and reality:\n\nMCCARTHY: \"Gas prices are the highest since 2014 — just as summer starts. The recent hack of the Colonial Pipeline exposed the flaws of Biden's approach to our country's energy policies. On day one he signed an executive order cancelling the Keystone XL Pipeline.\" — blog post Monday.\n\nREP. LIZ CHENEY, R-Wyoming: \"From cancelling the Keystone Pipeline to banning new oil & gas leasing on federal lands, Biden's energy policies are having devastating consequences. We've already seen a glimpse of this devastation with prices skyrocketing & gas shortages hitting communities across the country.\" — tweet Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Biden's action on the Keystone XL pipeline has nothing to do with the recent spike in gasoline prices. The pipeline handles crude oil, running from Canada to Texas through the Midwest, not gasoline, which had shortages on the East Coast after the Colonial Pipeline hack.\n\nBiden's order on his first day in office rescinded the construction permit for an extension to the main Keystone pipeline, which is still operating and runs about 2,687 miles (4,324 km) from Alberta to Illinois and Texas.\n\nAn expanded 1,210-mile (1,947-km) pipeline was planned to allow the system to carry up to 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day, passing through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska.\n\nBut shortages of crude oil haven't been a factor.\n\nNoteworthy is that while gas prices are at their highest level in six years, oil prices are still slightly below where they were in 2018. That suggests oil supplies are adequate and the refining and distribution of gasoline — through such networks as the Colonial Pipeline — are the problem.\n\nMCCARTHY: \"Despite gas prices being at historic lows this time last year, the average price for a gallon of gas is currently an astounding $3.10. That's the highest it's been since 2014, the last time Joe Biden was in the White House.\" — blog post on Monday.\n\nREPUBLICANS on the HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE: \"Biden's policies have led to the highest gas prices in six years.\" — tweet Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Biden's policies aren't behind the price increases. Gas prices are up because of a rapid and unexpected bounce-back in demand, and because of lingering problems from the forced shutdown early this month of the Colonial Pipeline, which provides 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast."}

The pipeline carries refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel from Houston, Texas, on the U.S. Gulf Coast up to Linden, New Jersey, and serves several markets along the route through various branch lines. Because no refineries between Alabama and the mid-Atlantic produce substantial quantities of transportation fuels, the southeastern United States is supplied primarily by pipeline flows, and to a lesser degree, with marine shipments from the U.S. Gulf Coast and imports.\n\nUntil Colonial Pipeline resumes operation, petroleum distribution terminals in the Southeast will rely on inventories and on supplies obtained from alternative sources, such as the smaller 720,000 b/d Products (SE) Pipeline that also carries petroleum products from the U.S. Gulf Coast to as far as Washington, DC.\n\nPipeline shipments move at approximately five miles per hour, so some markets may need to rely on inventories for several days after Colonial Pipeline service is restored.

I want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against COVID-19, the progress we've made, and the work we have left to do.\n\nAnd it starts with understanding this: Even as the Delta variant 19 [sic] has — COVID-19 — has been hitting this country hard, we have the tools to combat the virus, if we can come together as a country and use those tools.\n\nIf we raise our vaccination rate, protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing, and identify people who are infected, we can and we will turn the tide on COVID-19.\n\nIt will take a lot of hard work, and it's going to take some time. Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated, even though the vaccine is safe, effective, and free.\n\nYou might be confused about what is true and what is false about COVID-19. So before I outline the new steps to fight COVID-19 that I'm going to be announcing tonight, let me give you some clear information about where we stand.\n\nFirst, we have cons- — we have made considerable progress\n\nin battling COVID-19. When I became President, about 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated. Today, over 175 million Americans have that protection.\n\nBefore I took office, we hadn't ordered enough vaccine for every American. Just weeks in office, we did. The week before I took office, on January 20th of this year, over 25,000 Americans died that week from COVID-19. Last week, that grim weekly toll was down 70 percent.\n\nAnd in the three months before I took office, our economy was faltering, creating just 50,000 jobs a month. We're now averaging 700,000 new jobs a month in the past three months.\n\nThis progress is real. But while America is in much better shape than it was seven months ago when I took office, I need to tell you a second fact.\n\nWe're in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while. The highly contagious Delta variant that I began to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it did in other countries before us.\n\nWhile the vaccines provide strong protections for the vaccinated, we read about, we hear about, and we see the stories of hospitalized people, people on their death beds, among the unvaccinated over these past few weeks.\n\nThis is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And it's caused by the fact that despite America having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19. Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up, they're ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities. This is totally unacceptable."}

This alert provides a brief overview of the content and timing of the principal initiatives, and previews certain objections likely to be raised in legal challenges that some governors and others have said they will file.\n\nOSHA rule requiring all employers with 100+ employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly, and to pay for vaccination time.\n\nThe President announced that the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is developing an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) that will require all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that their workforce is fully vaccinated or to require any workers who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative test result at least weekly before coming to work. The rule—which is expected to issue within weeks—will require employers with more than 100 employees to provide paid time off for the time it takes for workers to get vaccinated and to recuperate if they experience serious side effects from the vaccination.\n\nOSHA ETS's are authorized by statute, which permits the Secretary of Labor to promulgate an ETS when he determines (1) \"that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards,\" and (2) \"that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.\"[1] An ETS may be in place for up to six months, at which point OSHA must issue a permanent standard that has been adopted through ordinary rulemaking processes.[2] This would be OSHA's second COVID ETS, following an ETS adopted in June that was limited to the health care sector.[3]\n\nOSHA likely does not plan a notice-and-comment process for the forthcoming rule, which is not required for an ETS. As a consequence, the standard's specific requirements likely will become known the day of publication, with an effective date shortly thereafter. Uncertainties that issuance of the rule should resolve include how it would apply to employees working at home, or to workers at remote locations without contact with other employees.\n\nThe decision to adopt the rule as an \"emergency\" and \"temporary\" standard, without notice and comment, could be one focus of a legal challenge. A challenge may also target the rule's wage-payment requirement; wages are not a subject that OSHA ordinarily regulates, and the requirement arguably contrasts with Congress's decision to let the COVID-related paid leave programs established by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act expire after December 31, 2020. If the ETS requires vaccination for workers who recently had and recovered from COVID-19, that could be targeted also.\n\nExecutive Orders requiring vaccinations for employees of federal contractors, and for all federal workers.\n\nIn announcing the OSHA ETS, the President also issued separate Executive Orders regarding vaccination of employees of federal contractors, and regarding vaccination of federal workers."}

But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,\" he said, all but biting off his words. The unvaccinated minority \"can cause a lot of damage, and they are.\"\n\nRepublican leaders — and some union chiefs, too — said Biden was going too far in trying to muscle private companies and workers, a certain sign of legal challenges to come.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said in a statement that \"Biden and the radical Democrats (have) thumbed their noses at the Constitution,\" while American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley insisted that \"changes like this should be negotiated with our bargaining units where appropriate.\"\n\nOn the other hand, there were strong words of praise for Biden's efforts to get the nation vaccinated from the American Medical Association, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable — though no direct mention of his mandate for private companies.\n\nThe expansive rules mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly, affecting about 80 million Americans. And the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated.\n\nBiden is also requiring vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government — with no option to test out. That covers several million more workers.\n\nBiden announced the new requirements in a Thursday afternoon address from the White House as part of a new \"action plan\" to address the latest rise in coronavirus cases and the stagnating pace of COVID-19 shots.\n\nJust two months ago Biden prematurely declared the nation's \"independence\" from the virus. Now, despite more than 208 million Americans having at least one dose of the vaccines, the U.S. is seeing about 300% more new COVID-19 infections a day, about two-and-a-half times more hospitalizations, and nearly twice the number of deaths compared to the same time last year. Some 80 million people remain unvaccinated.\n\n\"We are in the tough stretch and it could last for a while,\" Biden said.\n\nAfter months of using promotions to drive the vaccination rate, Biden is taking a much firmer hand, as he blames people who have not yet received shots for the sharp rise in cases killing more than 1,000 people per day and imperiling a fragile economic rebound.\n\nIn addition to the vaccination requirements, Biden moved to double federal fines for airline passengers who refuse to wear masks on flights or to maintain face covering requirements on federal property in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines."}

These rare occurrences are known as \"breakthrough cases\" which are to be expected, and historically known to occur with other vaccines as none is 100% effective.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently monitors hospitalizations and deaths, from any cause, among fully vaccinated individuals with COVID-19, but not breakthrough infections, which it stopped monitoring as of May 1. CDC presents this data in aggregate at the national level but not by state, and there is no single, public repository for data by state or data on breakthrough infections, since the CDC stopped monitoring them.\n\nWe therefore reviewed the websites and other official state sources for all 50 states and D.C. to see which are providing data on COVID-19 breakthrough cases, hospitalizations and deaths, how regularly, and what those data may tell us. We only used data from official state sources (we did not include data available only in news media reports, for example). Where a state did not provide comparable data on overall COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths reported over the period in which it captured breakthrough events, we obtained data on cases and deaths from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard and on hospitalizations from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services for the appropriate period (see methods for more detail).\n\nImportantly, not all hospitalizations and deaths of those fully vaccinated and diagnosed with COVID-19 are due to COVID-19 or have a known cause at the time of reporting. The CDC reports that as of July 19, of 5,601 hospitalized breakthrough cases, 27% were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19 and of 1,141 fatal cases, 26% were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19. States differ in whether they provide this detail. DC, for example, reports that as of July 11, 50% of hospitalized breakthrough cases were due to COVID-19, 19% were not, and 31% were of unknown reason. However, few states made these distinctions. Where they did, we only included breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19. In other cases, some of these breakthrough events may be due to causes other than COVID-19.\n\nOverall, we find that:\n\nHalf of states (25) report some data on COVID-19 breakthrough events (see Table 1) . Twenty-four provide data on breakthrough cases, 19 on hospitalizations and on deaths.\n\nTwenty-four provide data on breakthrough cases, 19 on hospitalizations and on deaths. Fifteen of these states regularly update these data, often on a weekly basis. The rest use a different frequency, have one-time reports, have stopped updating, or have an unclear reporting frequency.\n\nThe rest use a different frequency, have one-time reports, have stopped updating, or have an unclear reporting frequency. The data reported from these states indicate that breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are extremely rare events among those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (see Figure 1). The rate of breakthrough cases reported among those fully vaccinated is below 1% in all reporting states, ranging from 0.01% in Connecticut to 0.54% in Arkansas. The hospitalization rate among fully vaccinated people with COVID-19 ranged from effectively zero (0.00%) in California, Delaware, D.C., Indiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Vermont, and Virginia to 0.06% in Arkansas. (Note: Hospitalization may or may not have been due to COVID-19.) The rates of death among fully vaccinated people with COVID-19 were even lower, effectively zero (0.00%) in all but two reporting states, Arkansas and Michigan where they were 0.01%. (Note: Deaths may or may not have been due to COVID-19.)\n\nThe rate of breakthrough cases reported among those fully vaccinated is below 1% in all reporting states, ranging from 0.01% in Connecticut to 0.54% in Arkansas.\n\nAlmost all (more than 9 in 10) COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have occurred among people who are unvaccinated or not yet fully vaccinated, in those states reporting breakthrough data (see Figure 2). The reported share of COVID-19 cases among those not fully vaccinated ranged from 94.1% in Arizona to 99.85% Connecticut. The share of hospitalizations among those with COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated ranged from in 95.02% in Alaska to 99.93% in New Jersey. (Note: Hospitalization may or may not have been due to COVID-19.) The share of deaths among people with COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated ranged from to 96.91% in Montana to 99.91% in New Jersey. (Note: Deaths may or may not have been due to COVID-19.)\n\nNote that as more people get vaccinated, the share of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths accounted for by unvaccinated people will tend to fall, since there will be fewer unvaccinated people in the population. That will be true even if infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 is still very rare among vaccinated people."}

As the first round of vaccine recipients become eligible to receive their second dose, we want to remind the public about the importance of receiving COVID-19 vaccines according to how they've been authorized by the FDA in order to safely receive the level of protection observed in the large randomized trials supporting their effectiveness.\n\nWe have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19. These are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials. However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence. Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19.\n\nThe available data continue to support the use of two specified doses of each authorized vaccine at specified intervals. For the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 21 days between the first and second dose. And for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 28 days between the first and second dose.\n\nWhat we have seen is that the data in the firms' submissions regarding the first dose is commonly being misinterpreted. In the phase 3 trials, 98% of participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech trial and 92% of participants in the Moderna trial received two doses of the vaccine at either a three- or four-week interval, respectively. Those participants who did not receive two vaccine doses at either a three-or four-week interval were generally only followed for a short period of time, such that we cannot conclude anything definitive about the depth or duration of protection after a single dose of vaccine from the single dose percentages reported by the companies.\n\nUsing a single dose regimen and/or administering less than the dose studied in the clinical trials without understanding the nature of the depth and duration of protection that it provides is concerning, as there is some indication that the depth of the immune response is associated with the duration of protection provided. If people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks.\n\nWe know that some of these discussions about changing the dosing schedule or dose are based on a belief that changing the dose or dosing schedule can help get more vaccine to the public faster. However, making such changes that are not supported by adequate scientific evidence may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.\n\nWe have committed time and time again to make decisions based on data and science. Until vaccine manufacturers have data and science supporting a change, we continue to strongly recommend that health care providers follow the FDA-authorized dosing schedule for each COVID-19 vaccine."}

During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).\n\nThe two agencies have determined the following:\n\nUse of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States.\n\nThe FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.\n\nThe FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine's known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older.\n\nAt this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk.\n\nHealth care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) and Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers, which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.\n\nCDC's independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met today to discuss the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed.\n\n\"Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We've lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC's review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,\" said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner.\n\n\"Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,\" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. \"Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events – out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered – and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I continue to be encouraged by the growing body of real-world evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they protect people from disease, hospitalization, and death. I urge anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department.\"\n\nAssessment of Available Data\n\nMedical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC reviewed several sources of information and data related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to reach today's decision.\n\nSpecifically, the agencies assessed reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), reviewed the medical literature and considered the information from global regulatory partners about thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that have been reported following use of a similar, yet not identical, COVID-19 vaccine using a virus from the adenovirus family that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2."}

Enthusiasm is somewhat lower among parents of children ages 5-11 who became eligible for vaccination more recently, with 16% saying their younger child has gotten at least one vaccine dose and another 13% saying they plan to get them vaccinated \"right away.\" Three in ten parents of both teens and younger children say they will \"definitely not\" get their child vaccinated for COVID-19. The latest KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor survey of parents was conducted prior to the emergence of the omicron COVID-19 variant, and we will continue to track parents' attitudes and intentions as more information emerges on the potential impact of this new variant on children.\n\nSafety and potential side effects continue to be prominent concerns when it comes to parents' views of COVID-19 vaccines for kids. While about six in ten parents (63%) say they are confident that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe for adults, fewer say they are confident the vaccines are safe for children between the ages of 12 and 17 (52%) and for children ages 5 to 11 (43%). Most parents say getting infected with COVID-19 would be a bigger risk to their child's health than getting vaccinated. However, majorities of unvaccinated parents and Republican parents believe the vaccine poses a greater risk than the virus itself, even though scientific bodies have concluded the opposite is the case.\n\nAccess barriers are also a concern for some parents when it comes to getting their children vaccinated. Hispanic parents, Black parents, and those with lower incomes are more likely than other parents to say they are concerned they might have to miss work to get their child vaccinated, that they won't have a trusted place to go, or that they'll have difficulty traveling to a vaccination location.\n\nPediatricians remain parents' most trusted source of information on the COVID-19 vaccine for children, including across partisans and across race and ethnicity. Still, fewer than half of parents of children ages 5 to 17 have talked with their child's pediatrician or health care provider about the vaccine. Notably, not all pediatricians are recommending that parents get their children vaccinated for COVID-19; among the 40% of parents who spoke with their child's health care provider, one-third (16% total parents of teens) say the provider did not recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for their teen and four in ten (15% of total parents of 5-11 year-olds) say the doctor did not recommend it for their child ages 5-11.\n\nAbout half of parents of school-age children say their child's school provided information about how to get their child vaccinated for COVID-19, and more than four in ten say their child's school encouraged parents to get their children vaccinated. Parents who say their school has encouraged them to get their children vaccinated are more likely to say their child has indeed gotten vaccinated. In fact, parents of 5-11 year-olds whose school encouraged vaccination are four times as likely as those whose school did not encourage vaccination to say their younger child has already gotten the COVID-19 vaccine (28% vs. 7%). While previous KFF Vaccine Monitor reports have shown that a majority of the public supports COVID-19 vaccination requirements for K-12 school teachers, parents oppose schools requiring COVID-19 vaccines for eligible students by a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nParents and families have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic with nearly three in four of parents (73%) saying the pandemic has had a negative impact on their children's education, almost six in ten (58%) saying it has negatively impacted their own mental health, and half reporting a negative impact on their ability to pay for basic necessities (50%). The share reporting a negative financial impact is substantially higher among lower-income parents compared to those with higher incomes and among Black and Hispanic parents compared to White parents. In addition, mothers are more likely than fathers to say the pandemic has taken a toll on their financial situation as well as their mental and physical health."}

As of Oct. 17, 691 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the U.S. in individuals less than 18 years of age, with 146 deaths in the 5 through 11 years age group.\n\n\"The FDA is committed to making decisions that are guided by science that the public and healthcare community can trust. We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind this authorization. As part of our commitment to transparency around our decision-making, which included our public advisory committee meeting earlier this week, we have posted documents today supporting our decision and additional information detailing our evaluation of the data will be posted soon. We hope this information helps build confidence of parents who are deciding whether to have their children vaccinated,\" said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\nThe FDA has determined this Pfizer vaccine has met the criteria for emergency use authorization. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in individuals down to 5 years of age outweigh the known and potential risks.\n\nFDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data\n\nThe effectiveness data to support the EUA in children down to 5 years of age is based on an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study that has enrolled approximately 4,700 children 5 through 11 years of age. The study is being conducted in the U.S., Finland, Poland and Spain. Children in the vaccine group received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing 10 micrograms of messenger RNA per dose. The FDA analyzed data that compared the immune response of 264 participants from this study to 253 participants 16 through 25 years of age who had two higher doses of the vaccine in a previous study which determined the vaccine to be effective in preventing COVID-19. The immune responses of the younger age participants were comparable to the older participants.\n\nThe FDA also conducted a preliminary analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring seven days after the second dose. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, 3 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1,305 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 663 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19.\n\nFDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data\n\nThe available safety data to support the EUA include more than 4,600 participants (3,100 vaccine, 1,538 placebo) ages 5 through 11 years enrolled in the ongoing study. In this trial, a total of 1,444 vaccine recipients were followed for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose.\n\nCommonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first dose. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days.\n\nThe FDA and CDC safety surveillance systems have previously identified increased risks of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart) following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, particularly following the second dose, and with the observed risk highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Therefore, the FDA conducted its own benefit-risk assessment using modelling to predict how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine in children 5 through 11 years of age would prevent versus the number of potential myocarditis cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths that the vaccine might cause. The FDA's model predicts that overall, the benefits of the vaccine would outweigh its risks in children 5 through 11 years of age.\n\nOngoing Safety Monitoring\n\nPfizer Inc. has updated its safety monitoring plan to include evaluation of myocarditis, pericarditis and other events of interest in children 5 through 11 years of age. In addition, the FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and allow for the rapid detection and investigation of potential safety problems.\n\nIt is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report to any serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death in vaccinated individuals. It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Pfizer Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports to the FDA."}

Paxlovid is available by prescription only and should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis of COVID-19 and within five days of symptom onset.\n\n\"Today's authorization introduces the first treatment for COVID-19 that is in the form of a pill that is taken orally — a major step forward in the fight against this global pandemic,\" said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"This authorization provides a new tool to combat COVID-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge and promises to make antiviral treatment more accessible to patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19.\"\n\nPaxlovid is not authorized for the pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 or for initiation of treatment in those requiring hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19. Paxlovid is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination and a booster dose are recommended. The FDA has approved one vaccine and authorized others to prevent COVID-19 and serious clinical outcomes associated with a COVID-19 infection, including hospitalization and death. The FDA urges the public to get vaccinated and receive a booster if eligible. Learn more about FDA-approved or -authorized COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPaxlovid consists of nirmatrelvir, which inhibits a SARS-CoV-2 protein to stop the virus from replicating, and ritonavir, which slows down nirmatrelvir's breakdown to help it remain in the body for a longer period at higher concentrations. Paxlovid is administered as three tablets (two tablets of nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir) taken together orally twice daily for five days, for a total of 30 tablets. Paxlovid is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days.\n\nThe issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of scientific evidence available and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product. Based on the FDA's review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that Paxlovid may be effective for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in authorized patients. The agency has also determined that the known and potential benefits of Paxlovid, when used consistent with the terms and conditions of the authorization, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. There are no adequate, approved and available alternatives to Paxlovid for the treatment of COVID-19."}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is scheduled to meet Friday to discuss further clinical recommendations regarding immunocompromised individuals. Today's action does not apply to people who are not immunocompromised.\n\n\"The country has entered yet another wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the FDA is especially cognizant that immunocompromised people are particularly at risk for severe disease. After a thorough review of the available data, the FDA determined that this small, vulnerable group may benefit from a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Vaccines,\" said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \"Today's action allows doctors to boost immunity in certain immunocompromised individuals who need extra protection from COVID-19. As we've previously stated, other individuals who are fully vaccinated are adequately protected and do not need an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine at this time. The FDA is actively engaged in a science-based, rigorous process with our federal partners to consider whether an additional dose may be needed in the future.\"\n\nPeople who are immunocompromised in a manner similar to those who have undergone solid organ transplantation have a reduced ability to fight infections and other diseases, and they are especially vulnerable to infections, including COVID-19. The FDA evaluated information on the use of a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Vaccines in these individuals and determined that the administration of third vaccine doses may increase protection in this population. These patients should be counseled to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, close contacts of immunocompromised persons should get vaccinated, as appropriate for their health status, to provide increased protection to their loved ones.\n\nIt is recommended that immunocompromised individuals discuss monoclonal antibody treatment options with their health care provider should they contract or be exposed to COVID-19. The FDA has authorized monoclonal antibody treatments for emergency use during this public health emergency for adults and pediatric patients (ages 12 and older weighing at least 40 kilograms or about 88 pounds) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. One authorized product includes use for preventative (prophylaxis) treatment after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2; however, this product is not a substitute for vaccination.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is currently authorized for emergency use in individuals ages 12 and older, and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized for emergency use in individuals ages 18 and older. Both vaccines are administered as a series of two shots: the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered three weeks apart, and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is administered one month apart. The authorizations for these vaccines have been amended to allow for an additional, or third, dose to be administered at least 28 days following the two-dose regimen of the same vaccine to individuals 18 years of age or older (ages 12 or older for Pfizer-BioNTech) who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise."}

I received that report earlier this month, and asked for additional follow-up. As of today, the U.S. Intelligence Community has \"coalesced around two likely scenarios\" but has not reached a definitive conclusion on this question.

With the pace of vaccinations likely to accelerate rapidly in the coming weeks — Pfizer and Moderna, the makers of the two currently approved mRNA vaccines, have each promised to deliver 100 million doses by the end of March, with Johnson & Johnson providing an additional 20 million — many more U.S. residents will suddenly have access to a vaccine.\n\nThat's good news, except for the fact that recent polls show a distressing number of people are still uncertain about whether they will get vaccinated when it's their turn. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in late February found that 44% of U.S. adults are still on the fence or unlikely to be vaccinated: 22% said they wanted to wait and see how the vaccines are working, 7% would get a vaccine only if it was required of them, and 15% said they definitely would not get vaccinated.\n\nThat could translate into a protracted recovery for the country, as most experts estimate that 80% to 85% of the population needs to have some level of immunity for the pandemic to end.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has many causes, not least among them distrust of the medical establishment — particularly among Black and Latinx communities — and concern about the rapid development of the vaccines.\n\nIn recent weeks, though, mixed messaging about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines — whether they work, whether they protect against the new coronavirus variants, whether we can ever stop masking and social distancing — has many experts concerned that even more people will opt out.\n\n\"I'm concerned that there are some broad statements about the vaccines that are informing the dialogue that aren't true that are making people really worried,\" says Monica Gandhi, MD, MPH, professor of medicine and associate division chief of the Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine at the University of California San Francisco at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center.\n\nWe spoke with Gandhi and several other prominent academic experts about some common myths — and facts — about the vaccines.\n\nMyth #1: The vaccines are dangerous."}

This is significant progress, made possible by a vaccinations program that made shots free and convenient for months. But more vaccinations are needed to save lives, protect the economy, and accelerate the path out of the pandemic. To that end, in July, President Biden began rolling out vaccination requirements for federal employees and contractors and calling on employers to do the same. Thousands of organizations across the country have answered the President's call, and vaccination requirements have already helped reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans by approximately 40 percent since July.\n\nToday, the Biden Administration is announcing the details of two policies to fight COVID-19 that will drive even more progress and result in millions of Americans getting vaccinated, protecting workers, preventing hospitalization, saving lives, and strengthening the economy.\n\nFirst, the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is announcing the details of a requirement for employers with 100 or more employees to ensure each of their workers is fully vaccinated or tests for COVID-19 on at least a weekly basis. The OSHA rule will also require that these employers provide paid-time for employees to get vaccinated, and ensure all unvaccinated workers wear a face mask in the workplace. OSHA has a strong 50-year record of requiring employers to take common sense actions to prevent workers from getting sick or injured on the job. This rule will cover 84 million employees.\n\nSecond, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing the details of its requirement that health care workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid are fully vaccinated.

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced results from a Phase 2/3 trial showing a favorable safety profile and robust neutralizing antibody responses in children 5 to 11 years of age using a two-dose regimen of 10 μg administered 21 days apart, a smaller dose than the 30 μg dose used for people 12 and older. The antibody responses in the participants given 10 μg doses were comparable to those recorded in a previous Pfizer-BioNTech study in people 16 to 25 years of age immunized with 30 μg doses. The 10 μg dose was carefully selected as the preferred dose for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age. These are the first results from a pivotal trial of a COVID-19 vaccine in this age group.\n\n\"Over the past nine months, hundreds of millions of people ages 12 and older from around the world have received our COVID-19 vaccine. We are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population, subject to regulatory authorization, especially as we track the spread of the Delta variant and the substantial threat it poses to children,\" said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. \"Since July, pediatric cases of COVID-19 have risen by about 240 percent in the U.S. – underscoring the public health need for vaccination. These trial results provide a strong foundation for seeking authorization of our vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and we plan to submit them to the FDA and other regulators with urgency.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to be able to submit data to regulatory authorities for this group of school-aged children before the start of the winter season,\" said Dr. Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech. \"The safety profile and immunogenicity data in children aged 5 to 11 years vaccinated at a lower dose are consistent with those we have observed with our vaccine in other older populations at a higher dose.\"\n\nThe data summarized from this Phase 2/3 study, which is enrolling children 6 months to 11 years of age, was for 2,268participants who were 5 to 11 years of age and received a 10 μg dose level in a two-dose regimen. In the trial, the SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) was 1,197.6 (95% confidence interval [CI, 1106.1, 1296.6]), demonstrating strong immune response in this cohort of children one month after the second dose. This compares well (was non-inferior) to the GMT of 1146.5 (95% CI: 1045.5, 1257.2) from participants ages 16 to 25 years old, used as the control group for this analysis and who were administered a two-dose regimen of 30 μg. Further, the COVID-19 vaccine was well tolerated, with side effects generally comparable to those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech plan to share these data with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulators as soon as possible. For the United States, the companies expect to include the data in a near-term submission for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as they continue to accumulate the safety and efficacy data required to file for full FDA approval in this age group. A request to the EMA to update the EU Conditional Marketing Authorization is also planned. Topline readouts for the other two age cohorts from the trial – children 2-5 years of age and children 6 months to 2 years of age – are expected as soon as the fourth quarter of this year."}

Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they're made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO's Vaccines Explained series.\n\nVaccines are a critical tool in the battle against COVID-19, and getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.\n\nGetting vaccinated is safer than getting infected\n\nVaccines train our immune system to recognize the targeted virus and create antibodies to fight off the disease without getting the disease itself. After vaccination, the body is ready to fight the virus if it is later exposed to it, thereby preventing illness.\n\nMost people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, develop an immune response within the first few weeks, but we are still learning how strong and lasting that immune response is, and how it varies between different people.\n\nPeople who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 should still get vaccinated unless told otherwise by their health care provider. Even if you've had a previous infection, the vaccine acts as a booster that strengthens the immune response. There have also been some instances of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 a second time, which makes getting vaccinated even more important.\n\nWhat to expect during vaccination\n\nMedical professionals can best advise individuals on whether or not, and when, they should receive a vaccine. A health worker will administer the vaccine, and the person receiving it will be asked to wait for 15–30 minutes before leaving the vaccination site. This is so that health workers can observe individuals for any unexpected reactions following vaccination.\n\nLike any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild-to-moderate side effects, such as a low-grade fever or pain or redness at the injection site. These should go away on their own within a few days. See WHO's Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines explainer and Vaccines Safety Q&A to learn more about common side effects and find out who should consult with a doctor before vaccination.\n\nVaccine doses\n\nFor some COVID-19 vaccines, two doses are required. It's important to get the second dose if the vaccine requires two doses.\n\nFor vaccines that require two doses, the first dose presents antigens – proteins that stimulate the production of antibodies – to the immune system for the first time. Scientists call this priming the immune response. The second dose acts as a booster, ensuring the immune system develops a memory response to fight off the virus if it encounters it again.\n\nBecause of the urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine, initial clinical trials of vaccine candidates were performed with the shortest possible duration between doses. Therefore an interval of 21–28 days (3–4 weeks) between doses is recommended by WHO. Depending on the vaccine, the interval may be extended for up to 42 days – or even up to 12 weeks for some vaccines – on the basis of current evidence.\n\nThere are many COVID-19 vaccines being developed and produced by different manufacturers around the world. WHO recommends that a vaccine from the same manufacturer be used for both doses if you require two doses. This recommendation may be updated as further information becomes available.\n\nSafety against infection and transmission after vaccination\n\nAvailable clinical trials have shown COVID-19 vaccines to be safe and highly effective at preventing severe disease. Given how new COVID-19 is, researchers are still looking into how long a vaccinated person is likely to be protected from infection, and whether vaccinated people can still transmit the virus to others. As the vaccine rollout expands, WHO will continue to monitor the data alongside regulatory authorities."}

We are closely monitoring the situation and are committed to communicating with the public as we learn more.\n\nHistorically, the work to obtain the genetic information and patient samples for variants and then perform the testing needed to evaluate their impact takes time. However, we expect the vast majority of this work to be completed in the coming weeks.\n\nThe FDA has been actively monitoring for the possible emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants since early in the pandemic and has worked with medical product developers when a new variant (or mutation) emerges that could impact product performance.\n\nWith industry guidance laid out in February and contingency plans already in place, we are well-positioned and committed to working with companies to evaluate and expeditiously address the potential impact of emerging and future viral mutations on COVID-19 tests, therapeutics and vaccines.\n\nWe've taken a number of steps to adapt to emerging variants thus far in the pandemic, such as requiring companies to actively monitor for and evaluate the impact of variants on their products as a condition of authorization, and quickly taking appropriate action.\n\nThe agency has previously limited the scope of use of certain monoclonal antibodies depending on variants circulating in certain areas, updated fact sheets for health care providers with information about how known variants impact certain therapeutics, and communicated with the public about tests affected by viral mutations.\n\nWe anticipate having more information from the ongoing evaluation regarding if and how well the current vaccines work against this variant in the next few weeks.

This decision was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes. Here is a summary of what is currently known.\n\nCurrent knowledge about Omicron\n\nResearchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies as they become available.\n\nTransmissibility: It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible (e.g., more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including Delta. The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.\n\nSeverity of disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta. Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron. There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants. Initial reported infections were among university students—younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease—but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is always key.\n\nEffectiveness of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nPreliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become reinfected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern, but information is limited. More information on this will become available in the coming days and weeks.\n\nEffectiveness of vaccines: WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines. Vaccines remain critical to reducing severe disease and death, including against the dominant circulating variant, Delta. Current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death.\n\nEffectiveness of current tests: The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with Omicron, as we have seen with other variants as well. Studies are ongoing to determine whether there is any impact on other types of tests, including rapid antigen detection tests.\n\nEffectiveness of current treatments: Corticosteroids and IL6 Receptor Blockers will still be effective for managing patients with severe COVID-19. Other treatments will be assessed to see if they are still as effective given the changes to parts of the virus in the Omicron variant.\n\nStudies underway\n\nAt the present time, WHO is coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand Omicron. Studies currently underway or underway shortly include assessments of transmissibility, severity of infection (including symptoms), performance of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatments."}

The TAG-VE was convened on 26 November 2021 to assess the SARS-CoV-2 variant: B.1.1.529.\n\nThe B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on 24 November 2021. The epidemiological situation in South Africa has been characterized by three distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly the Delta variant. In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.\n\nThis variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation. Using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.\n\nThere are a number of studies underway and the TAG-VE will continue to evaluate this variant. WHO will communicate new findings with Member States and to the public as needed.\n\nBased on the evidence presented indicative of a detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, the TAG-VE has advised WHO that this variant should be designated as a VOC, and the WHO has designated B.1.1.529 as a VOC, named Omicron.\n\nAs such, countries are asked to do the following:\n\nenhance surveillance and sequencing efforts to better understand circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nsubmit complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, such as GISAID.\n\nreport initial cases/clusters associated with VOC infection to WHO through the IHR mechanism.\n\nwhere capacity exists and in coordination with the international community, perform field investigations and laboratory assessments to improve understanding of the potential impacts of the VOC on COVID-19 epidemiology, severity, effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostic methods, immune responses, antibody neutralization, or other relevant characteristics.\n\nIndividuals are reminded to take measures to reduce their risk of COVID-19, including proven public health and social measures such as wearing well-fitting masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, and getting vaccinated.\n\nFor reference, WHO has working definitions for SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Interest (VOI) and Variant of Concern (VOC).\n\nA SARS-CoV-2 VOI is a SARS-CoV-2 variant:\n\nwith genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape; AND\n\nthat has been identified as causing significant community transmission or multiple COVID-19 clusters, in multiple countries with increasing relative prevalence alongside increasing number of cases over time, or other apparent epidemiological impacts to suggest an emerging risk to global public health.\n\nA SARS-CoV-2 VOC is a SARS-CoV-2 variant that meets the definition of a VOI (see above) and, through a comparative assessment, has been demonstrated to be associated with one or more of the following changes at a degree of global public health significance:"}

I promised when I got elected that I'd always give it to you straight from the shoulder — the good, the bad, the truth.\n\nSo, as we head into Christmas weekend, I want to answer your questions about the rising number of COVID cases — COVID-19 cases.\n\nAnd I want to start by acknowledging how tired, worried, and frustrated I know you are. I know how you're feeling.\n\nFor many of you, this will be the first or even the second Christmas where you look — across the table will be an empty kitchen chair there.\n\nTens of millions have gotten sick, and we've all experienced an upheaval in our lives.\n\nBut while COVID has been a tough adversary, we've shown that we're tougher — tougher because we have the power of science and vaccines that prevent illness and save lives, and tougher because of our resolve.\n\nSo, that — let me answer some questions that lay out the steps the Vice President and I are taking to prepare for the rising number of cases experts tell us we could expect in the weeks ahead.\n\nFirst, how concerned should you be about Omicron, which is now the dominant variant in this country and it happened so quickly?\n\nThe answer is straightforward: If you are not fully vaccinated, you have good reason to be concerned. You're at a high risk of getting sick. And if you get sick, you're likely to spread it to others, including friends and family. And the unvaccinated have a significantly higher risk of ending up in a hospital or even dying.\n\nAlmost everyone who has died from COVID-19 in the past many months has been unvaccinated. Unvaccinated.\n\nBut if you're among the majority of Americans who are fully vaccinated, and especially if you've gotten the booster shot — that third shot — you're much — you have much, much less reason to worry. You have a high degree of protection against severe illness.\n\nAnd because Omicron spreads so easily, we'll see some fully vaccinated people get COVID, potentially in large numbers. There will be positive cases in every office, even here in the White House, among the unv- — among the vaccinated — among the vaccinated — from Omicron.\n\nBut these cases are highly unlikely to lead to serious illness.\n\nVaccinated people who get COVID may get ill, but they're protected from severe illness and death. That's why you should still remain vigilant."}

While many people with COVID-19 get mild symptoms, others can become seriously ill. Several vaccines have been developed to protect against COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has so far authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. Two of these are the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Both of these vaccines require two doses. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has also been authorized for emergency use. However, this vaccine only requires one dose. Why do some vaccines require two doses? How long do you need to wait between doses? Do you have any immunity after the first dose? This article will help explain why you need two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and will provide answers to many other questions, too.\n\nHow do these vaccines work? The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both use mRNA technology. The cells in your body naturally use mRNA all the time to create many different types of proteins that you need to stay healthy. The mRNA in the two-dose COVID-19 vaccines provide the cells of your body with instructions on how to make the spike protein that's specific to the new coronavirus. This spike protein is found on the surface of the virus. It uses this spike protein to attach to and enter a host cell in your body. When you get your COVID-19 vaccine, your immune system processes information on the spike protein and generates an immune response to it. This includes the production of antibodies. Vaccines hinge on a very important aspect of your immune system, which is the fact that it has memory. After your vaccination, your immune system continues to store information on the spike protein. If you're exposed to the new coronavirus, your immune system will then use this stored information to respond and protect you from the virus. This can help prevent you from becoming sick with COVID-19. The entire immunity process typically takes around 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine. That's why you can still contract the new coronavirus and become ill if you're exposed to it shortly after getting your vaccine."}

KFF analysis found that, following vaccine rollout in winter 2020-2021, weekly cases and deaths in long-term care facilities (including nursing homes, assisted living facilities, ICF/IIDs, and other settings) dropped, reaching an all-time low in June 2021, just prior to the rapid increase in national cases and deaths due to the Delta variant. As Delta spread across the US in the summer of 2021, much of the focus was on young children at risk during back-to-school; however, with the Delta surge, older Americans, especially those 85 and older, continued to face higher risk of death due to COVID-19 compared to younger Americans, according to the CDC. This data note analyzes federal nursing home data to determine the ongoing impact of the pandemic on COVID-19 cases and deaths among staff and residents. See methods box for more details.\n\nNursing homes across the US reported nearly 1,800 COVID-19 deaths among residents and staff in August 2021, the highest number of COVID-19 deaths reported in a single month since February 2021 and a steady increase from the approximately 350 deaths reported in July 2021 (Figure 1). This jump in the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 reverses the sustained pattern of decreasing deaths since CMS implemented the Pharmacy Partnership For Long-Term Care, even though the number of nursing home deaths due to COVID-19 in August 2021 was still far below the peak of over 22,000 seen in December 2020 (Table 1).\n\nDeaths attributable to COVID-19 increased at a faster rate in nursing homes than among all others in the community between July and August 2021. The number of COVID-19 deaths among staff and residents in nursing homes quadrupled between July and August, while COVID-19 deaths in the community doubled in the same time period (Table 1). During this period, deaths increased at a faster rate among nursing home residents than among nursing home staff (423% versus 274%). While the vast majority of COVID-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge, and not immune from the most recent wave."}

Some countries have given emergency use authorization for mRNA vaccines for use in the adolescent age group (aged 12-17 years): BNT162b2 developed by Pfizer, and mRNA 1273 developed by Moderna. In November 2021, one stringent regulatory authority approved the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 for the use in children aged 5-11. Trials in children as young as age 3 years were completed for two inactivated vaccines (Sinovac-CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV) and these products were approved by Chinese authorities for the age indication of 3-17 years; although these vaccine products have received EUL for adults, they have not yet received WHO EUL for children. Covaxin, an adjuvanted inactivated vaccine developed by Bharat, was approved in India for the age indication of 12-17 years; but not yet received WHO EUL for this age indication. The Indian regulatory authorities have given approval to ZycovD, a novel DNA vaccine, for ages 12-17 years; however, this vaccine has not yet received WHO EUL. Several COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing trials in younger age groups (including as young as 6 months of age), but results have not yet been published.\n\nThe greatest burden of disease in terms of severe disease and deaths remains among older persons and those with comorbidities, the evidence of which led to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap which identifies high priority-use groups according to vaccine supplies available to countries(1). WHO recognizes that various countries are in different pandemic phases with different vaccination coverage rates. The WHO global vaccination strategy targets remain: 40% of each country's population by end of 2021, and 70% by mid-2022(2). These coverage targets were set to ensure an equitable pace of global vaccine rollout & prioritization of those at highest risk. To date, these targets have not yet been achieved.\n\nThis interim statement examines the role of COVID-19 vaccines in adolescents and children in the global context of inequitable vaccine distribution across countries and globally limited vaccine supply.\n\nBurden of disease in children and adolescents\n\nOverall, there are proportionally fewer symptomatic infections, and cases with severe disease and deaths from COVID-19 in children and adolescents, compared with older age groups. Age-disaggregated cases reported to WHO from 30 December 2019 to 25 October 2021(3) show that children under five years of age represent 2% (1 890 756) of reported global cases and 0.1% (1 797) of reported global deaths. Older children and younger adolescents (5 to 14 years) account for 7% (7 058 748) of reported global cases and 0.1% (1 328) of reported global deaths while older adolescents and young adults (15 to 24 years) represent 15% (14 819 320) of reported global cases and 0.4% (7 023) of reported global deaths. Deaths for all ages less than 25 years represented less than 0.5% of reported global deaths."}

With news from Pfizer that clinical trials showed their COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective for children ages five to eleven, the Vaccine Monitor (conducted September 13-22, with the bulk of interviews concluding before Pfizer's announcement) finds that about a third of parents (34%) say they will vaccinate their 5-11 year old child \"right away\" once a vaccine is authorized for their age group.\n\nAs policymakers and school leaders across the country implement policies to help limit the spread of COVID-19 in school and keep children safe, a majority of parents (58%) say K-12 schools should require all students and staff to wear masks while at school while about a third (35%) say schools should have no mask requirements at all. Regardless of preferences, nearly seven in ten parents with a child attending in-person school (69%) say their school is requiring all students and staff to wear masks and just 28% say their school has no mask requirement. While mask requirements appear to be widespread in schools, COVID-19 testing is less common with half of parents saying their school district is not offering testing to students who are not eligible to get the vaccine.\n\nWhile two-thirds (66%) of parents with a child attending in-person school say their child's school is doing about the right amount to limit the spread of COVID-19 at school, almost one in four parents of a child attending in-person school (23%) say their child has been required to quarantine at home due to a possible COVID-19 exposure since the school year began.\n\nTrends In COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake Among Children\n\nFive months after the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine's use in children ages 12 and over, nearly half (48%) of parents of children ages 12-17 say their child has received at least one dose of a vaccine. The share of parents who say they want to \"wait and see\" before getting their 12-17 year old vaccinated has decreased to 15%, down from 23% in July. Just 4% of parents say they will only get their teenager vaccinated \"if their school requires it,\" and one in five (21%) say they will \"definitely not\" vaccinate their child, similar to the share measured in previous months.\n\nOn September 20th, Pfizer announced that clinical trials showed their COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective for children ages five to eleven. The KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor (conducted September 13-22, with the bulk of interviews concluding before Pfizer's announcement) finds that about a third of parents (34%) say they will vaccinate their 5-11 year old child \"right away\" once a vaccine is authorized for their age group. About a third of parents (32%) say they will \"wait and see\" how the vaccine is working before having their 5-11 year old vaccinated. Notably, the share who say they definitely won't get their 5-11 year old vaccinated remains steady at one in four (24%).\n\nParents continue to be more cautious about getting their younger children vaccinated with about one in four (23%) saying they will get their child under the age of 5 vaccinated right away once a vaccine is available for that age group and about a third (35%) saying they will definitely not get their child under 5 vaccinated for COVID-19."}

Today, 2 in 3 eligible individuals – 189 million Americans – are fully vaccinated. That's an increase from approximately 2 million reported when the President took office. The potential authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11, which is currently under consideration by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), would be another major milestone in our efforts to build on this historic progress and protect even more Americans.\n\nIn anticipation of the FDA's independent advisory committee meeting on October 26 and the CDC's independent advisory committee meeting on November 2-3, today the Biden Administration is announcing a plan to ensure that, if a vaccine is authorized for children ages 5-11, it is quickly distributed and made conveniently and equitably available to families across the country. The start of a vaccination program for children ages 5-11 will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process and timeline, but our planning efforts mean that we will be ready to begin getting shots in arms in the days following a final CDC recommendation. These steps will be critical in ensuring that we are staying ahead of the virus by keeping kids and families safe, especially those at highest risk.\n\nMillions of adolescents ages 12-17 have been safely vaccinated, and we know vaccines work. Fully vaccinated individuals are 10 times less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 and have a high degree of protection, including against the Delta variant. The consequences of a pediatric COVID-19 case can be serious and potentially last months.\n\nAs with vaccination for those 12 and older, the success of this program will rely heavily on states, Tribes, and territories to help implement a smooth rollout. A major component of the Administration's operational planning is working closely with state and local leaders to ensure they are prepared to distribute and administer vaccines.

Many of our colleagues (including leading scientists and health-care professionals) have died. We have also seen how much harder it has become for people with HIV to get treatment and monitoring, which has meant more people being admitted to hospital with serious illnesses such as tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nAs the world shifts gear in the COVID-19 pandemic — from tackling the immediate crisis to a long-term public-health response — we urge governments, health ministries, researchers and other stakeholders worldwide to devote more of their resources and attention to the interactions between COVID-19 and HIV.\n\nVarious studies from before the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines show that people with HIV are 30–50% more likely to die from COVID-19. What's more, a failure to tackle the pandemic with sufficient urgency in countries with high rates of uncontrolled advanced HIV could lead to the emergence of variants of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that spread more easily between people or render the vaccines less effective. Conversely, both diseases could be curbed more effectively if they are tackled simultaneously, with public-health responses strengthened by the lessons learnt from both.\n\nRisk analysis\n\nIn 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a platform for standardized clinical data obtained from people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. A preliminary analysis of these data from 37 countries (most of which come from South Africa) revealed that, controlling for other factors, people with HIV were 30% more likely to die from COVID-19 among those hospitalized with the disease1.\n\nIn a more detailed analysis2 of hospitalized cases in South Africa, only people with HIV at an advanced stage were more likely to die from COVID-19. People in this group are severely immunocompromised: individuals have a blood count of fewer than 200 CD4 T cells per microlitre, compared with 500–1,500 cells per microlitre in people without HIV. (CD4 T cells are white blood cells crucial for fighting infection.) In a population-based analysis of around 3.5 million people from the Western Cape Province of South Africa (around 500,000 of whom were HIV-positive), people with HIV were twice as likely to die from COVID-193. But for those with uncontrolled or advanced HIV, the risk of dying from COVID‐19 was almost four times higher3.\n\nOther reports over the past year from various countries indicate that people with weakened immune systems can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 for several weeks or months. (By contrast, those who are otherwise healthy take, on average, around two weeks to clear an infection.) Such prolonged infections have mainly been documented in people receiving cancer chemotherapy and other immunosuppressive agents. But they have also been seen in people with advanced uncontrolled HIV."}

It portrays a president who turned his back on science and endangered the health and lives of Brazilians.\n\nCovid-19 has killed more than 600,000 Brazilians, but thousands of those deaths could have been avoided, evidence presented in the report indicates.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro spread false information about Covid-19, opposed social distancing, refused to wear masks, and routinely shook hands with crowds of supporters. His ultimate goal, the report concluded, was rapid contagion so that Brazil would reach herd immunity.\n\nHe not only refused to follow World Health Organization recommendations to protect public health, but he sought to block Congress and local officials from following guidelines. For instance, in July 2020, he vetoed legal provisions to make mask wearing mandatory in churches and in Brazil's overcrowded prisons.\n\nAn episode in Amazonas state in January 2021 encapsulates the tragic consequences of those policies. In late 2020, local officials had warned the federal government of an impending shortage of oxygen, but instead of securing supply, the Bolsonaro administration sent drugs that have no proven effect against the virus, the report said. When the oxygen ran out, dozens of Covid-19 patients died.\n\nThe government sent the same unproven drugs to Indigenous people, the investigative committee found. It drafted a plan to protect them from Covid-19 only after repeated orders by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe report showed that the Bolsonaro administration did not respond to several offers of vaccines from the Butantan Institute – a research center owned by the São Paulo state government. The report also included testimony showing that Bolsonaro was presented with some evidence of corruption in one vaccine procurement contract. A witness said Bolsonaro committed to report the case to federal police, \"but that did not happen,\" the report said.\n\nThe report recommended a variety of criminal charges against Bolsonaro and other officials, as well as his impeachment.

These steps include increasing the vaccine supply to states, Tribes, and territories and increasing funding to jurisdictions to help turn vaccines into vaccinations. And, the President announced that starting next week, the first phase of the federal pharmacy program will launch and select pharmacies nationwide will start offering vaccinations for their communities.\n\nThese new steps will help meet the President's goal of administering 100 million shots in 100 days and expand access to vaccines to more Americans in the coming weeks.\n\nThe President is taking the following actions today:\n\nExpanding Vaccine Supply: Building on last week's announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration will increase overall, weekly vaccine supply to states, Tribes, and territories to 10.5 million doses nationwide beginning this week. This is a 22% increase since taking office on January 20. The Administration is committing to maintaining this as the minimum supply level for the next three weeks, and we will continue to work with manufacturers in their efforts to ramp up supply.\n\nLaunching First Phase of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination: As part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines, starting on February 11, those eligible for the vaccine will have the opportunity to be vaccinated at select pharmacies across the country through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. This program is a public-private partnership with 21 national pharmacy partners and networks of independent pharmacies representing over 40,000 pharmacy locations nationwide (listed below). It is a key component of the Administration's National Strategy to expand equitable access to vaccines for the American public.\n\nAs the first phase of this program launches, select retail pharmacies nationwide will receive limited vaccine supply to vaccinate priority groups at no cost. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked with states to select initial pharmacy partners based on a number of factors including their ability to reach some of the populations most at risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Americans should check their pharmacy's website to find out if vaccine is available as supply will be limited in the initial phase. More information is available at cdc.gov/covid19."}

The State Department of Health will issue Section 16 Orders requiring all hospital, LTCF, and nursing homes to develop and implement a policy mandating employee vaccinations, with limited exceptions for those with religious or medical reasons. To date, 75% of the state's ~450,000 hospital workers, 74% of the state's ~30,000 adult care facility workers, and 68% of the state's ~145,500 nursing home workers have completed their vaccine series. Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul's administration was briefed prior to the announcement.\n\n\"When COVID ambushed New York last year, New Yorkers acted, while the Federal Government denied the problem,\" Governor Cuomo said. \"Now, the Delta variant is spreading across the nation and across New York -- new daily positives are up over 1000% over the last six weeks, and over 80 percent of recent positives in New York State are linked to the Delta variant. We must now act again to stop the spread. Our healthcare heroes led the battle against the virus, and now we need them to lead the battle between the variant and the vaccine. We have always followed the science, and we're doing so again today, with these recommendations by Dr. Zucker and federal and state health experts. But we need to do more. I have strongly urged private businesses to implement vaccinated-only admission policies, and school districts to mandate vaccinations for teachers. Neither will occur without the state legally mandating the actions -- private businesses will not enforce a vaccine mandate unless it's the law, and local school districts will be hesitant to make these challenging decisions without legal direction.\"\n\nGovernor Cuomo also announced that the Department of Health has authorized a third COVID-19 vaccine dose for New Yorkers with compromised immune systems, following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation last week. Eligible New Yorkers can receive their third dose 28 days after the completion of their two-dose vaccine series, effective immediately.\n\nThe CDC is currently recommending that moderately to severely immunocompromised people receive an additional dose, including people who have:\n\nBeen receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood;\n\nReceived an organ transplant and are taking medications to suppress the immune system;\n\nReceived a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system;\n\nModerate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome);\n\nAdvanced or untreated HIV infection;\n\nActive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy that causes severe immunosuppression, or other medications that may suppress your immune response."}

The vaccine is produced by the Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac.\n\n\"The world desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,\" said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products. \"We urge manufacturers to participate in the COVAX Facility, share their knowhow and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.\"\n\nWHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply and international procurement. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe EUL assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements. The assessment is performed by the product evaluation group, composed by regulatory experts from around the world and a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in charge of performing the risk-benefit assessment for an independent recommendation on whether a vaccine can be listed for emergency use and, if so, under which conditions.\n\nIn the case of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, the WHO assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility.\n\nThe Sinovac-CoronaVac product is an inactivated vaccine. Its easy storage requirements make it very manageable and particularly suitable for low-resource settings.\n\nWHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also completed its review of the vaccine. On the basis of available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of those vaccinated and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population.\n\nFew older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group. Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because data collected during subsequent use in multiple countries and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons. There is no reason to believe that the vaccine has a different safety profile in older and younger populations. WHO recommends that countries using the vaccine in older age groups conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to verify the expected impact and contribute to making the recommendation more robust for all countries.\n\nWHO emergency use listing\n\nThe emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies.

The candidate showed 100% protection against moderate and severe disease. In people at high risk of developing complications from COVID-19 (people 65 years or older and people under age 65 with certain comorbidities or with likely regular exposure to COVID-19), the vaccine showed 91.0% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease.\n\nSafety data indicate the investigational vaccine was generally well-tolerated. Mild-to-moderate injection site pain and tenderness were the most common local symptoms among participants, and fatigue, headache and muscle pain lasting less than two days were the most common systemic symptoms.\n\nNovavax, Inc., of Gaithersburg, Maryland, developed the investigational vaccine and led the clinical trial known as PREVENT-19. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a component of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, provided funding support for the trial as part of the federal COVID-19 response.\n\nThe PREVENT-19 trial began in late December 2020 and enrolled adult volunteers at 119 study sites, including those in the NIAID-supported COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN). Participants were randomly assigned to receive two shots, 21 days apart, of either the investigational vaccine or a saline placebo. Randomization occurred in a 2:1 ratio with two volunteers receiving NVX-CoV2373 for each one who received placebo. Because the trial was blinded, neither investigators nor participants knew who received the candidate vaccine.\n\nPREVENT-19 was designed to evaluate whether NVX-CoV2373 can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 disease seven or more days after the second injection relative to placebo. The results shared today are based on 77 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 that investigators observed among trial participants from January 25 through April 30, 2021.

But obviously that's not measuring an immune response directly – it's using quite a crude measure of how many people have been infected.\" Altmann explains that he wouldn't advise anyone to consider themself safe 14 days after their first dose of the vaccine. \"The graph is just a way of saying 'something is happening',\" he says.\n\nIn a more recent development, an Israeli academic who coordinated the country's Covid-19 response – Professor Nachman Ash – has claimed that a single dose of the vaccine is not as effective as Pfizer originally estimated. However, the comments have been widely criticised.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that it is inappropriate to compare the research, which was conducted by the health organisation Clalit, with the Pfizer study. For one, the Israeli study found that a single dose of the vaccine reduced the number of people testing positive for the virus, i.e. being infected, by 33%, while the Pfizer paper suggested that it would prevent 52% from developing symptoms – they looked at two different things.\n\nIn addition, the data from Clalit has not been made available, or peer-reviewed. It also involved examining the impact of the vaccine just two weeks after people had received it – considered too early to see an immune response – rather than three, as in the Pfizer study. Finally, the research was not a clinical trial, but rather an observational study, which means the results should be viewed with caution.\n\nOxford-AstraZeneca\n\nFor the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, things are a bit different. In a paper published in January, the authors explain that the vaccine offers protection of 64.1% after at least one standard dose. This compares to 70.4% if you've had two full doses, or – oddly – 90% in people who have had one half dose followed by one full dose.\n\nA month later, AstraZeneca revealed the results of a first analysis of their phase III trial data in a press release. Starting from 22 days after the first dose, the vaccine provided 70% protection against mild or moderate illness and 100% against severe disease, hospitalisation and death.\n\nBecause the phase three trial included two gaps between the first and the second dose – including one of six weeks and a longer one of 12 weeks – it's possible to say with more certainty that the first dose can continue to provide some protection for at least a few months before the booster shot."}

And with a significant percentage of the world's population not yet vaccinated against COVID, the coronavirus has a lot of room to infect people, mutate and, eventually, form new variants. The newest coronavirus variant that health officials are watching is \"delta plus,\" a mutation of the now-dominant delta variant. The original delta is highly contagious, suspected to cause more-severe disease and, according to an estimate by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, responsible for about 93% of coronavirus cases in the US right now.\n\nThough news of coronavirus variants (alpha, beta, delta, lambda and so on) can be overwhelming, not every variant is cause for more concern than the original coronavirus.\n\nWe'll break down what scientists know right now about delta plus, and how concerned we should be about it.\n\nDelta vs. delta plus\n\nIn June, health officials in India called out delta plus as a \"variant of concern\" because it's thought to be better at binding to lung cells and could possibly evade treatments for COVID. Delta plus has been detected in several other regions, including the US, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Russia and China, the BBC reported. South Korea is the latest country to raise a red flag about delta plus, identifying the variant in a man with no recent travel records, according to Reuters.\n\nThe \"plus\" in delta plus refers to the newer variant's K417N spike protein mutation, The Washington Post noted. (Spike proteins are what allows COVID and other viruses to get into our cells.) This mutation, also found in the earlier beta variant, can make certain COVID-19 treatments less effective, according to the CDC, adding emphasis to the warning from India.\n\nWill delta plus be worse than the already horrible delta? To survive well enough and become a dominant variant, a variant needs to infect a lot of people and prove to be more transmissible. So far, delta plus hasn't done that, but more research is needed.\n\n\"You need to study a few hundred patients who are sick with this condition and variant and find out whether they are at greater risk of greater disease than the ancestral variant,\" virologist Dr. Gagandeep Kang told the BBC.\n\nColin Angus, a public health policy modeler and analyst in England, told The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that it (delta plus) conveys enough of a benefit to the virus to allow it to dominate the original delta variant. So although it is clearly here, there is no obvious sign that it has gained a foothold over existing variants of the virus.\"\n\nHow concerned should we be?\n\nAs long as the coronavirus is around and a good portion of the population is unvaccinated, we should be concerned because the virus will continue to mutate, according to US President Joe Biden's medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nIn an interview with McClatchy, Fauci said that though \"we're very lucky that the vaccines that we have now do very well against the variants -- particularly against severe illness,\" there could be a variant in the future that will \"push aside\" delta and be as transmissible, cause more-severe disease and get around our vaccines. The CDC refers to these variants as \"variants of high consequence.\" Right now there are none.\n\nGetting the \"overwhelming proportion of the population\" vaccinated will \"crush the outbreak,\" Fauci said. But until then, the coronavirus has \"ample chance\" to morph, he said.\n\n\"People who are not getting vaccinated mistakenly think it's only about them. But it isn't,\" Fauci said. \"It's about everybody else, also.\""}

Bailey, M.D., immediate past president of the American Medical Association. \"With more than 300 million doses administered in the United States and nearly 4 billion doses administered worldwide, we know the vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19. Increased vaccinations among health care personnel will not only reduce the spread of COVID-19 but also reduce the harmful toll this virus is taking within the health care workforce and those we are striving to serve.\"\n\nDue to the recent COVID-19 surge and the availability of safe and effective vaccines, our health care organizations and societies advocate that all health care and long-term care employers require their workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This is the logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment of all health care workers to put patients as well as residents of long-term care facilities first and take all steps necessary to ensure their health and well-being.\n\nBecause of highly contagious variants, including the Delta variant, and significant numbers of unvaccinated people, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are once again rising throughout the United States1. Vaccination is the primary way to put the pandemic behind us and avoid the return of stringent public health measures.\n\nUnfortunately, many health care and long-term care personnel remain unvaccinated. As we move towards full FDA approval of the currently available vaccines, all health care workers should get vaccinated for their own health, and to protect their colleagues, families, residents of long-term care facilities and patients. This is especially necessary to protect those who are vulnerable, including unvaccinated children and the immunocompromised. Indeed, this is why many health care and long-term care organizations already require vaccinations for influenza, hepatitis B, and pertussis.\n\nWe call for all health care and long-term care employers to require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nWe stand with the growing number of experts and institutions that support the requirement for universal vaccination of health workers2, 3. While we recognize some workers cannot be vaccinated because of identified medical reasons and should be exempted from a mandate, they constitute a small minority of all workers. Employers should consider any applicable state laws on a case-by-case basis.\n\nExisting COVID-19 vaccine mandates have proven effective4, 5. Simultaneously, we recognize the historical mistrust of health care institutions, including among many in our own health care workforce. We must continue to address workers' concerns, engage with marginalized populations, and work with trusted messengers to improve vaccine acceptance."}

This statement reflects the current understanding of vaccine performance and supply as presented to SAGE on 7 December 2021. It summarizes and contextualizes current evidence on booster vaccination.

This note focuses only on booster doses.\n\nBooster doses are administered to a vaccinated population that has completed a primary vaccination series (currently one or two doses of EUL COVID-19 vaccine depending on the product) when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population.

The objective of a booster dose is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient. Additional doses of a vaccine may be needed as part of an extended primary series for target populations where the immune response rate following the standard primary series is deemed insufficient. The objective of an additional dose in the primary series is to enhance the immune response to establish a sufficient level of effectiveness against disease. In particular, immunocompromised individuals often fail to mount a protective immune response after a standard primary series, but also older adults may respond poorly to a standard primary series with some vaccines (1).\n\nGlobal context\n\nThe Director-General of WHO has called for a moratorium on booster vaccination for healthy adults until the end of 2021 to counter the persisting and profound inequity in global vaccine access (2).

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current vaccines protect people well against all the common variants.\n\nDuring a company earnings call on Wednesday morning, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, who leads worldwide research, development and medical for Pfizer, called the new data on a third dose of vaccine \"encouraging.\"\n\n\"Receiving a third dose more than six months after vaccination, when protection may be beginning to wane, was estimated to potentially boost the neutralizing antibody titers in participants in this study to up to 100 times higher post-dose three compared to pre-dose three,\" Dolsten said in prepared remarks. \"These preliminary data are very encouraging as Delta continues to spread.\"\n\nThe data also show that antibody levels are much higher against the original coronavirus variant and the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa, after a third dose.\n\nSeparately, Pfizer and its partner BioNtech released new safety and efficacy data for their coronavirus vaccine Wednesday, and said it shows protection holds up for at least six months, although it may start to wane slightly towards the end of that time.\n\nThe pre-print paper, posted Wednesday to the online server medrxiv.org, updates results from Pfizer's trial involving 44,000 volunteers around the world.\n\nIt found the overall efficacy was about 91% during the six months. Vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was about 97%, the data show. The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed nor published in a journal.\n\nThe data show that the vaccine's efficacy peaked at more than 96% from a week to around two months after receiving a second dose of vaccine, and then appeared to gradually decline to 83.7% four to six months later, with an average decline of about 6% over the last two months.\n\nEarlier this month, Pfizer announced it has seen waning immunity from its coronavirus vaccine, saying it is picking up its efforts to develop a third dose that will protect people from variants. The company also specified it would seek emergency use authorization under the US Food and Drug Administration for a third dose in August.\n\nBut in an unusual move, the FDA and CDC said at the time Americans don't need third doses quite yet and that it was not up to companies alone to decide when an additional dose might be needed.\n\nUS Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy repeated that point Wednesday morning, telling CNN's Poppy Harlow, \"People do not need to go out and get a booster shot.\""}

The agreements include supply of the initial two doses of their vaccines as well as billions of dollars in potential boosters for wealthy nations.\n\nGoing forward, analysts have forecast revenue of over $6.6 billion for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and $7.6 billion for Moderna in 2023, mostly from booster sales. They eventually see the annual market settling at around $5 billion or higher, with additional drugmakers competing for those sales.\n\nThe vaccine makers say that evidence of waning antibody levels in vaccinated people after six months, as well as an increasing rate of breakthrough infections in countries hit by the Delta variant, support the need for booster shots.\n\nSome early data suggests that the Moderna vaccine, which delivers a higher dose at the outset, may be more durable than Pfizer's shot, but more research is needed to determine whether that is influenced by the age or underlying health of the people vaccinated.\n\nAs a result, it is far from clear how many people will need boosters, and how often. The profit potential of booster shots may be limited by the number of competitors who enter the market. In addition, some scientists question whether there is enough evidence that boosters are needed, particularly for younger, healthy people. The World Health Organization has asked governments to hold off on booster shots until more people worldwide receive their initial doses.\n\n\"We don't know what the market forces will be,\" Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview last week. \"At some point, this will become a more traditional market - we'll look at what are the populations at risk, what value are we creating, and what are the number of products that serve that value.

The U.S. alone has recorded over 745,000 lives lost, more than any other nation.\n\n\"This is a defining moment in our lifetime,\" said Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Public Health. \"What do we have to do to protect ourselves so we don't get to another 5 million?\"\n\nThe death toll, as tallied by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the populations of Los Angeles and San Francisco combined. It rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo. Globally, COVID-19 is now the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe staggering figure is almost certainly an undercount because of limited testing and people dying at home without medical attention, especially in poor parts of the world, such as India.\n\nHot spots have shifted over the 22 months since the outbreak began, turning different places on the world map red. Now, the virus is pummeling Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, especially where rumors, misinformation and distrust in government have hobbled vaccination efforts. In Ukraine, only 17% of the adult population is fully vaccinated; in Armenia, only 7%.\n\n\"What's uniquely different about this pandemic is it hit hardest the high-resource countries,\" said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health center at Columbia University. \"That's the irony of COVID-19.\"\n\nWealthier nations with longer life expectancies have larger proportions of older people, cancer survivors and nursing home residents, all of whom are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, El-Sadr noted. Poorer countries tend to have larger shares of children, teens and young adults, who are less likely to fall seriously ill from the coronavirus.\n\nIndia, despite its terrifying delta surge that peaked in early May, now has a much lower reported daily death rate than wealthier Russia, the U.S. or Britain, though there is uncertainty around its figures.\n\nThe seeming disconnect between wealth and health is a paradox that disease experts will be pondering for years. But the pattern that is seen on the grand scale, when nations are compared, is different when examined at closer range. Within each wealthy country, when deaths and infections are mapped, poorer neighborhoods are hit hardest.\n\nIn the U.S., for example, COVID-19 has taken an outsize toll on Black and Hispanic people, who are more likely than white people to live in poverty and have less access to health care.\n\n\"When we get out our microscopes, we see that within countries, the most vulnerable have suffered most,\" Ko said."}

But other countries in Europe did poorly as well,\" said Cécile Viboud, an infectious diseases epidemiologist who has done a lot of research into deaths from the 1918 flu.\n\nWhether the Covid pandemic will qualify as the deadliest event in U.S. history is perhaps a question for Civil War historians. The long-accepted toll of the War Between the States was 620,000, which this pandemic has already surpassed. But in 2011, David Hacker, a historian at Binghamton University in New York State, published an article in the journal Civil War History arguing the true number of deaths in the Civil War was more likely around 750,000.\n\nThe heavy toll the pandemic has taken in the U.S. is due to the country's inadequate response early on, said Markel. David Morens, a medical historian at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n\"I think it's generally known around the world that America didn't do a very good job in the early stages of controlling the pandemic,\" said Morens, who has also written extensively on the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nComparing events that happened more than a century apart has its perils. For instance, the population of the United States in 1918 was a third of what it is now. So as a percentage of the national population, the Spanish flu deaths still has the lead on Covid-19.\n\nLikewise, the mean age of the people who died in 1918 was 28, whereas with Covid, deaths are occurring mainly in the elderly, said Viboud, who works at the National Institutes of Health's Fogerty International Center. In terms of cumulative years of life lost, the Spanish flu's impact thus remains greater.\n\nBut modern medicine is far more advanced than what was available in 1918. Now people whose lungs are under attack from Covid can be put on ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — ECMO — machines, which pump oxygen into blood when a person's heart and lungs are no longer up to the job. These were not options in 1918.\n\nAnd for months now, the country has had vaccines that are highly effective at lowering the risk of dying from Covid. Still the fatalities pile up, though at a slower rate than earlier in the pandemic."}

Chan School of Public Health answers that question.\n\nThe research, which assessed the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, is based on analysis of data from nearly 2 million individuals in Israel and represents one of the largest real-world assessments of COVID-19 vaccine safety to date.\n\nThe findings, the researchers said, affirm the overall safety of the vaccine and underscore that the risk of adverse consequences from actual infection with SARS-CoV-2 far outweighs potential vaccine risks.\n\nThe study involved two analyses: A comparison of adverse events between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and between unvaccinated people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and unvaccinated noninfected people.\n\nThe study showed that few adverse events were associated with the vaccine. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, the most serious of them, was rare, with a rate of 2.7 excess cases per 100,000 vaccinated people. This means that for every 100,000 individuals, 2.7 more cases of myocarditis occurred than would be expected, the researchers said.\n\nBy contrast, the risk of myocarditis was notably higher among infected but unvaccinated individuals, occurring at a rate of 11 excess cases per 100,000 people.\n\nCoronavirus infection—but not vaccination—was also associated with greatly increased risk of pericarditis (an inflammation of the area around the heart), heart arrhythmias, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, acute kidney damage, among others.\n\nVaccine hesitancy\n\n\"To date, one of the main drivers of vaccine hesitancy has been a lack of information regarding potential side effects of the vaccine,\" said study co-author Ben Reis, HMS assistant professor of pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital and director of the predictive medicine group in the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children's.\n\n\"This careful epidemiological study provides reliable information on vaccine safety, which we hope will be helpful to those who have not yet decided about vaccination,\" Reis said.\n\n\"Those who have hesitated until now to get vaccinated due to concerns about very rare side effects, such as myocarditis, should be aware that the risks for this very same side effect are actually higher among unvaccinated infected individuals,\" Reis said.\n\nThe results are based on records from Clalit Health Services in Israel, one of the world's largest integrated health record databases. The analysis is the largest peer-reviewed evaluation of the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine in a nationwide mass-vaccination setting.\n\n\"The extensive nationwide rollout of Israel's COVID-19 vaccination campaign provided the Clalit Research Institute with a unique opportunity to assess, through its rich and comprehensive digital datasets, the safety of the vaccine in a real-world setting, without needing to rely on individual-driven active reporting of side effects\" said study senior author Ran Balicer, director of the Clalit Research Institute and Chief Innovation Officer for Clalit.\n\n\"These results show convincingly that this mRNA vaccine is very safe and that the alternative of 'natural' morbidity caused by the coronavirus puts a person at significant, higher, and much more common risk of serious adverse events,\" Balicer said.\n\nThe results of this real-world study confirm, complement, and build on the previously reported findings of the Pfizer/BioNTech phase 3 randomized clinical trial, which involved 21,720 individuals, the researchers noted.\n\nThe comprehensive nature of this new analysis and the sheer volume of data involved offer a more detailed assessment of the vaccine's safety across a wider range of adverse events."}

More studies also need to be conducted to understand the clinical severity of the variant compared to previous variants, officials said.\n\n\"The full significance of this variant remains uncertain and the best tool we have is still the vaccines,\" De Oliveira said. He added that lab studies still need to be carried out to test vaccine and antibody evasion.\n\nUK bans flights from 6 African countries\n\nThe reaction to the announcement of the new variant discovered by South African health authorities was also prompt.\n\nUK's Health Minister Sajid Javid said flights to the UK from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe would be suspended from midday Friday and all six countries would be added to the red list – meaning UK residents and British and Irish nationals arriving home from those points of departure must undergo a 10-day hotel quarantine at their own expense.\n\n\"UKHSA is investigating a new variant. More data is needed but we're taking precautions now,\" Javid said, adding the variant identified in South Africa \"may be more transmissible\" than the Delta strain and that \"the vaccines that we currently have may be less effective.\"\n\nJavid added the UK \"hasn't detected any of this new variant\" in the country so far.\n\nOn Friday, South African officials will brief the World Health Organization, which has classified B.1.1.529 as a \"variant under monitoring.\"\n\nSouth Africa, like much of the region, has suffered through three significant Covid-19 waves since the pandemic's start. While the number of new infections across the country is now still relatively low and positivity levels are under 5%, public health officials have already predicted a fourth wave because of a slow vaccine uptake."}

The President committed to the American people that he would confront this unprecedented challenge with the full strength and capabilities of the federal government. Each day since taking office, the President has done just that – mobilizing a whole-of-government, wartime effort to defeat COVID-19. And, he has brought all Americans, including public and private sector leaders, together and asked them to do their part.\n\nThe results are clear: America is starting to look like America again, and entering a summer of joy and freedom.\n\n300 Million Shots in 150 Days\n\nWhen President Biden took office, about 5% of adult Americans had gotten vaccinated. At the pace the U.S. was vaccinating in January, it would have taken 336 days to get to 300 million shots in arms. And, inadequate vaccine supply, vaccinators, and places to get vaccinated severely limited Americans' access to vaccines.\n\nThanks to the Biden Administration's whole-of-government effort to stand up a first-of-its-kind, best-in-class nationwide vaccination program, today, more than 175 million Americans have gotten at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot.\n\n65% of adult Americans have at least one shot, and 55% of adults are fully vaccinated.\n\n87% of seniors and 74% of adults age 40 and over have at least one shot.\n\n15 states and Washington, D.C., have gotten at least 70% of adults one shot.\n\n26 states and D.C. have fully vaccinated 50% or more of adults.\n\nImportantly, this progress on vaccinations has brought COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths down to their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic last year. It's curbed the spread of the virus, saved tens of thousands of lives, and allowed tens of millions of Americans to get back to living their life.\n\nThis is a direct result of the Biden Administration's whole-of-government, wartime effort that focused on:\n\nSecuring enough supply for all Americans and getting it out the door as quickly as possible. When President Biden took office, there was not enough vaccine supply for all Americans, and states were not getting the supply allocation and delivery timeline information they requested and needed to be successful. Thanks to the President's aggressive actions, the Biden Administration secured enough supply for all Americans, dramatically increased supply to states, and gave states more visibility into allocation numbers to allow for better planning to get shots into arms much faster. This allowed the President to make all adults eligible for vaccination in mid-April – months ahead of expectations – and has positioned the U.S. to help lead the global efforts to vaccinate the world."}

Today, the agency authorized several tests for over-the-counter (OTC) use without a prescription when used for serial screening. In addition to the tests authorized for OTC use, one serial screening test was authorized for use in a point-of-care (POC) setting without a prescription, and an additional screening test was authorized for POC use with a prescription. The addition of the OTC and POC tests for screening will give schools, workplaces, communities and others several options for serial screening tests that are accurate and reliable.

With the FDA's authorization of multiple tests, the public can be assured these tests have met our scientific standards for emergency use authorization. As we've said all along, if it's a good test, we'll authorize it,\" said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \"The FDA has taken many steps to support test development throughout the pandemic, including authorizing tests quickly, offering many avenues for test developers to work with us to get their tests on the market, if shown to be accurate and reliable, and issuing enforcement policies for COVID-19 tests. As the pandemic has progressed, we have worked with test developers wishing to add screening claims.\"\n\nIn total, the FDA has authorized three tests with serial screening claims (testing asymptomatic individuals multiple times on a routine basis). Specific tests authorized this week:\n\nQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 test - authorized for OTC at-home serial screening\n\nAbbott BinaxNOW (multiple configurations) Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self Test – authorized for OTC at-home serial screening Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card 2 Home Test - authorized for OTC at-home serial screening with telehealth proctor Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag 2 Card – authorized for POC serial screening without a prescription\n\nBD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 – authorized for POC serial screening with a prescription\n\nThese tests had been previously authorized by the agency (some under different names) to test those with COVID-19 symptoms, but the actions this week authorize testing of asymptomatic individuals when used for serial testing.\n\nThese authorizations follow the agency's multiple steps to streamline the process for test developers interested in authorization for screening with serial testing to increase consumer access to testing, as well as information the FDA has issued to help schools, workplaces, communities, and others establish screening programs."}

A statement by the Suez Canal Authority initially blamed the incident on high winds and a sand storm that reduced visibility, but later said that strong winds were \"not the only cause,\" and that an investigation was ongoing.\n\nThere is no clear indication at this point that climate change played a role in the sandstorm that led to the ship's blocking the canal, but the incident raises intriguing questions that likely will prompt research into any correlation.\n\nThe multi-day shutdown of one of the world's busiest shipping chokepoints underscores the vulnerability of the global food system and economy to disruptions. That vulnerability is playing on the stage of increasingly extreme weather, rising seas, and an increasingly just-in-time world of shipping.\n\nFigure 1.

The Ever Given became stuck at 05:40 UTC that day. According to the GFS analysis, a sharp wind shift, with winds blowing out of the southwest to west, was present near the spot where the Ever Given blocked the canal, about five miles north of its connection with the Red Sea."}

EPA\n\n\"Global trade is at worldwide highs right now. Cargo is moving through the Suez Canal at record rates,\" said Salvatore Mercogliano, a maritime historian at Campbell University in North Carolina, at the time.\n\n\"In many ways, the Suez Canal is the only game in town in terms of these really large vessels going through and because it's such a substantial shortcut between Europe and Asia,\" he said.\n\nDrone footage captures efforts to free Ever Given in Suez Canal\n\nAbout 12 per cent of global trade — $10bn to $12bn a day — goes through the canal.\n\nThat year saw daily transit records broken, with 87 ships crossing the waterway on September 29. In November 2021, the canal authority recorded its highest monthly revenue of $571.3 million.\n\nWith such successes, it is perhaps even more important to review the lessons learnt to avoid a scenario similar to the Ever Given grounding in the future.\n\nA long history\n\nOpened on November 17, 1869, the canal recently celebrated 152 years in existence. During that time, 1.4 million ships carrying 24.7 billion tonnes of cargo navigated the waterway, paying fees of $147.1bn.\n\nThere have been other instances of ships running aground and blocking the canal, but none for as long as the Ever Given. Russian oil tanker Tropic Brilliance got stuck for three days in 2004 and the Hong Kong-flagged Okal King Dor blocked transit for eight hours in 2006.\n\n\"[The Ever Given grounding] was a one-off incident, which did cause a drastic disruption to trade. But if we look realistically over the past century of the operation of the canal, there have hardly been any incidents,\" said Ranjith Raja, oil research manager at Refinitiv.\n\nIn 2015, President Abdel Fattah El Sisi inaugurated the New Suez Canal, a second lane along part of the 193-kilometre waterway to allow for more ships to pass. The canal was also widened and deepened in other stretches.\n\nFurther canal expansion a necessity\n\nThe Ever Given ran aground during a sandstorm and strong winds in the southern stretch of the waterway, the longest single-lane portion.\n\n\"The most important thing is to create more two-lane segments in the canal,\" said Mohamed El Wakeel, vice dean of the College of Maritime Transport and Technology at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Transport.\n\nIn May, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) announced plans to widen and deepen the 30km stretch of waterway between the city of Suez and the Bitter Lake area by 2023.\n\nTwo-directional traffic in the canal lane further north will also be extended by 10km to a total length of 82km.\n\nContainer ships aren't getting any smaller\n\nThe Ever Given is one of the largest container ships ever built, nearly as long as the Empire State Building is tall. It is right at the maximum length allowed for transit in the Suez Canal.\n\nWhile its grounding brought into question whether such vessels are too big to safely operate in many ports and canals, it did not deter the construction of ultra-large ships.\n\n\"In the midst of Ever Given being stuck in the Suez, Ever Green, the ship's parent company, ordered vessels even larger than Ever Given at that same time,\" said Mr Mercogliano.\n\nAs long as major passages can accommodate these larger vessels, shipping companies will continue to build them, and vice versa. In May, the Panama Canal Authority increased the maximum length of ships allowed to pass through the waterway from 367 to 370 metres.\n\n\"From a trade perspective, it makes sense to have bigger vessels, which are capable of carrying more cargo and makes the overall cost of trade significantly lower,\" said Mr Raja.\n\nThe 'Ever Given', one of the world's largest container ships, sails in the Suez Canal after authorities agreed to a settlement with the vessel's owner and insurers."}

Smaller firms such as UK bicycle maker Pearson 1860 and Snuggy UK, which makes wearable blankets, also have vital orders stuck in limbo.\n\n\"We don't hold out much hope of seeing our stock this year and although it is insured in transit, we have guessed there will be little chance of seeing a settlement for months if not years,\" Will Pearson, director of Pearson 1860, told CNN Business. His company has products worth more than $100,000 on the ship.\n\nAn Egyptian court impounded the Ever Given and its 18,300 cargo containers after the Suez Canal Authority filed an initial $916 million compensation claim against Japanese ship owner Shoei Kisen Kaisha for damages and losses incurred when the ship ran aground in a narrow part of the canal, blocking traffic.\n\nThe Ever Given — and its cargo — are being held in the canal's Great Bitter Lake during the legal battle.\n\nThe container ship Ever Given moves in the Suez Canal, on March 29. Khaled Elfizi/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nSeveral companies with products on the Ever Given told CNN Business they have been left in the dark about the status of their goods as legal proceedings continue, and are excluded from negotiations surrounding their release. Even if a deal is reached, the companies or their insurers are likely to be on the hook for a portion of the settlement.\n\nThe companies may be forced to pay under a maritime law principle called \"general average,\" which requires parties involved in a voyage to proportionally share costs in the event of a loss. The principle has its roots in regulations governing maritime trade set out by the people of Rhodes more than a millennium ago in what is now Greece.\n\n\"If somebody [the ship owners in this case] incurs an extraordinary expense for the common good, then everybody is asked to contribute to it,\" said Jai Sharma, the head of cargo casualty at Clyde & Co., a law firm that represents companies and insurers with over $100 million in cargo on the Ever Given. The firm estimates the total value of goods on board to be $600 million to $700 million.\n\nShoei Kisen Kaisha declined to comment for this story. The Suez Canal Authority did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nStuck in limbo\n\nIKEA told CNN Business that it has a variety of products on board the ship, but declined to provide further specifics about the shipment. Lenovo confirmed it also has cargo aboard the ship, and a spokesperson said the company is \"exploring ways to recover the goods.\"\n\nThe stakes are even higher for companies like EasyEquipment, a small UK business that does not have marine insurance on $100,000 worth of commercial refrigerators that were supposed to be delivered to restaurants before coronavirus restrictions eased in May.\n\n\"Not only have we lost all profits from this crucial order, but this has also affected restaurant businesses that were hoping to reopen their doors after lockdown,\" said CEO Michael Shah. \"We're caught in this limbo, and I know I'm going to have to foot this added [general average] bill to get my stock back.\"\n\nPearson 1860 said it has received few updates regarding legal negotiations and the status of its shipment from canal authorities, Shoei Kisen Kaisha or Evergreen, which operates the vessel.\n\n\"There seems to be ongoing shifting of blame and insurance wrangling taking place between the ship owners, Evergreen and the Suez Canal authorities,\" said Pearson.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Snuggy, a small UK business that was founded just two years ago. Co-founder Jack Griffiths said over $550,000 worth of its best-selling product, a hooded wearable blanket, are on the ship. The business makes just two large orders per year, and this one was meant to see them through to the start of winter.\n\nGriffiths said the delay is causing major cash flow issues for the business.\n\n\"We haven't been informed of anything, we are completely powerless and left in the dark. I wish we were involved or even kept in the loop a little bit more, but we aren't. It's really not a great position to be in and it's a hurdle most new businesses will struggle to get over,\" he said."}

Two subsidiaries of Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the container vessels' owner, and Evergreen Group, a Taiwanese conglomerate that operated it under a long-term charter, had asked a London judge for the stay.\n\nEarlier this year, they obtained another order limiting some claims against the ship to 84 million pounds ($116 million).\n\nThe 400-meter-long Ever Given grounded in the Suez canal for several days in March, blocking the route in both directions and disrupting global trade.

When the ship became stuck, it was being led by a Suez Canal pilot, who had earlier taken over from the harbor pilot who had driven the ship from the Suez anchorage into the canal, he said.\n\nWhile there was some damage to the bow of the ship as a result of the incident, no injuries, deaths or pollution are understood to have occurred and the death of a canal worker involved in the re-floating is thought to be unrelated, he said.\n\nLawyers for the owner didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

He observed the global supply chain has been built \"...\" on top of ice shavings and toothpicks. There are weak points everywhere.

In a March 24 statement, Evergreen said gusty winds of about 56 kph had caused the ship's course to deviate.\n\nEvergreen had been all but free of accidents before last week, company followers say. They point to the discipline of Evergreen founder Chang Yung-fa, who died in 2016 at the age of 88.\n\nA native of a Taiwanese coastal village during Japan's 1895-1945 colonization, Chang worked at age 18 for a Japanese shipping line in Taipei and became third officer of a Taiwanese shipper after World War II. He eventually worked as a captain and helped start a marine shipping firm with friends before establishing Evergreen Marine on his own.\n\nChang launched the company in 1968 with a single second-hand ship. Evergreen's operating fleet has 200 container ships today.\n\nChang received a Japanese education when Japan colonized Taiwan from 1895 to 1945. That education fostered a management style that thrived on strict adherence to rules and allowed employees to find work offshore, people who follow the company say.\n\n\"The former owner, Mr. Chang Yung-fa, was educated in the style of the Japanese, so his method of management was like that of Japan,\" said Stone Huang, Taiwan managing director with the freight forwarding service JAS Worldwide. He works closely today with Evergreen staffers.\n\n\"So it was strict, plus his financial support was strong and a lot of the staff that turned over would go overseas,\" Huang said.\n\nEvergreen Marine, part of a transport-logistics conglomerate that includes Eva Airways, was shaken when the late founder's sons went to court over how to divide an inheritance, domestic media outlets reported. At stake was a $1.87 billion fortune. Three sons inherited the group of companies and an employee who had risen up since 1987 now runs the marine shipping side.\n\nThe marine shipper may be playing by different rules now compared to before Chang's death, said Liang Kuo-yuan, president of the Polaris Research Institute research organization in Taipei.\n\n\"The way of operating now I believe is not as top-down as it was under the Chang Yung-fa era,\" Liang said. \"When Chang said something, no one wouldn't dare not to do it.\n\n\"If he was still alive, I believe Chang would take on the whole thing himself,\" Liang added, referring to the Suez Canal mishap.\n\nEvergreen is leasing the Ever Given, the 20,000 twenty-ton equivalent cargo ship that got stuck March 23 in the canal and held up billions of dollars of freight every day. The company said its vessel was freed Monday afternoon.\n\nCompany spokespeople did not reply Monday to questions about the incident's impact on the company's reputation.

A detailed written recovery plan can serve as a roadmap that enables your organization to return to normal as fast as possible. It should include the following major provisions:\n\nGoals and objectives that must be met in order to fully recover from the crisis\n\nThe specific tasks that have to be performed, and who will be responsible for them\n\nA timeframe for recovery\n\nThe money, expertise, and other resources that will be needed\n\nA list of those who should be notified or consulted about the progress in recovering from the crisis\n\nThe lessons learned from this crisis, and and how those lessons will be applied to the operations and policies of the organization to ensure the crisis is not repeated\n\nJust as companies should test their crisis and contingency plans to ensure they work when needed, businesses should hold table top, simulations, and other exercises to stress-test their recovery plans ahead of time and on a regular basis.\n\nDamage Already Done\n\nIt does not take long for a crisis to have a negative impact on companies and organizations.\n\nPeter Deans is a risk and strategy consultant and founder of 52 Risks. He observed that, \"For many companies, the damage [from the Suez Canal crisis] has already been done, with costly delays arising from delays in receiving supply inputs or finished goods, either directly or indirectly via their suppliers.\n\n\"These delays will have resulted in lost sales and/or additional supply costs and freight charges. It will be important to reach out to those customers that will be impacted in the coming months.\" He predicted that, \"...supply chains will take at least several weeks if not months to return to normal.\"\n\nDeep Understanding Needed\n\nDeans noted, \"These type of events highlight the need for companies [to] have a deep understanding of their supply chains, understand 'what can go wrong' and have contingency plans for these scenarios. This includes having the financial resources to see through these incidents. Scenario planning workshops can be helpful in thinking about the specific events that can impact a business' operations.\n\n\"As the Covid-19 pandemic has shown, it is critically important to have sufficient supplies of production inputs... to withstand any extended, external shocks and business disruptions,\" he counseled.\n\nLimited Options\n\nDepending on the nature of a crisis, there may not be too many alternatives on how to bounce back. In the aftermath of the Suez Canal crisis, the options may be very limited.\n\nMark Dohnalek is the president and CEO of Pivot International, a global manufacturing, engineering, technology, product development company. \"For companies to recover as quickly as possible from the backlog of ships in the Suez, they will have no choice but to seek sourcing that uses transit routes outside of this area — either domestic or Asian,\" he said."}

The announcement of the increase in fees comes as the canal has been experiencing record traffic.\n\nRates for vessels transiting the canal will be increased by six percent beginning in February 2022. While the canal has benefitted dramatically from the increase in shipping volumes and the transit of new larger vessels, it has nonetheless also found itself facing increasing competition. During the spring blockage shipping lines elected to send some of their vessels around Africa while Russia heavily promoted the advantages of its North Sea Route. The Panama Canal has also been seeking to increase traffic offering increasing the competition with its tolls.\n\nAdmiral Osama Rabea, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, said in considering the rate increases they carefully followed and scrutinized all the variables related to the shipping market, global economic indicators, and global trade movement. He said that they seek to apply a balanced and flexible marketing and pricing strategy that fulfills the authority and its clients' interests and takes into account the global economic conditions. The rate hike was balanced with International Monitory Fund and World Trade organization projections for global economic growth while allowing them to provide navigational services for transiting through the canal. He also compared their services to other competitive routes.\n\nThe Canal Authority, however, said that it would exempt both LNG carriers and cruise ships from the increase in tariffs. The canal has seen a continuous seaborne trade for LNG but it is a very competitive market. During October, 84 LNG carriers transited the canal up from 46 the prior year with an 87 percent increase in tonnage. Going forward, the Authority is modifying rates for LNG carriers from 25 percent to 15 percent starting this month.\n\nCruise ships, they said, had been the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the efforts are designed to support a restoration of the traffic. Similarly, the Panama Canal Authority is also considering proposals to adjust the rates for cruise ships to also support their return.\n\nThe decision to raise the tariffs came after the Suez Canal set a new record for transits during October. The number of ships was up 14 percent year-over-year with a total of 1,847 transits. Net tonnage was up more than 11 percent to 112.1 million tons contributing to a 12 percent increase in revenues to over $551.1 million.\n\nThe Suez Canal recorded its highest ever daily transits on September 29, 2021. A total of 87 vessels made the passage totaling 4.8 million net tons. During the day, a total of 49 vessels were northbound while 38 made the southbound transit.\n\nDuring the first ten months of 2021, the Canal saw a nearly nine percent increase in tonnage.

And the Ever Given's fate mattered far beyond cybergawkers' sudden interest in massive container ships in distress: It mattered because every day the Ever Given blocked the canal, dozens of ships carrying billions of dollars' worth of cargo had to wait to enter the waterway.\n\nThe resulting supply chain delays are still reverberating months after the incident. After finally being dislodged, the Ever Given was pulled by several tugboats to the adjoining Great Bitter Lake, where a new crew of Indian seafarers took over. The retrieval crew that arrived in the Great Bitter Lake was led by Capt. Hanse Kurisinkal, a highly experienced Indian officer who has worked on ULCVs pretty much since they entered the seas.\n\nGlobal supply chain delays are still reverberating months after the ship got stuck in the Suez Canal.\n\nBoth Kurisinkal's crew and the crew they replaced were fortunate that the Ever Given has a reputable owner and a similarly reputable management company. In many other cases, crews of cargo ships stuck in ports or even offshore for various reasons are simply abandoned by the ship's owner. As I've previously reported in Foreign Policy, every year dozens of crews are left on their ships—without fuel, food, and even water—for months, sometimes even years, relying on charities and seafarer unions for their survival.\n\nUntil July, when Egyptian authorities and the Ever Given's insurer finally agreed on an undisclosed compensation payment for the rescue operation, the Ever Given and its new crew couldn't go anywhere. Their departure that day generated considerable press coverage—but since then, virtually nothing has been heard from the ill-fated ship. This is the story, based on exclusive interviews with industry insiders, of what happened next."}

They had initially demanded $916 million.\n\nHowever, the insurer of the vessel said this amount is still too high.\n\nThe massive container ship is currently still impounded in the Great Bitter Lake, a body of water roughly 30 miles from where it first got stuck."}

The ship, one of the largest in the world, became horizontally wedged in the canal last Tuesday. Since then crews worked night and day to free the vessel, which at more than 1,300 feet is almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall. Ultimately, the ship was dislodged around 9 a.m. ET on Monday after more than 10 tugboats arrived on the scene, along with specialized dredging equipment and expert salvage teams all working together to free the 220,000-ton vessel. But while traffic has now resumed in the key waterway, the repercussions after days of halted movement will continue to be felt.\n\nAround 12% of global trade flows through the Suez Canal on massive ships like the Ever Given, which can hold 20,000 containers. Lloyd's List estimates that more than $9 billion worth of goods passes through the 120-mile waterway each day, translating to around $400 million per hour. \"The disruption of a week of this size is going to continue to have cascading effects ... it's got to be at least 60 days before things get sorted out and appear to be a bit back to normal,\" said Stephen Flynn, professor of political science at Northeastern University. \"This level of disruption cascaded after every 24 hours,\" he added. The knock-on effects include congestion at ports as well as vessels not being in the right place for their next scheduled journey. Most importantly, it further exacerbates supply chains already reeling from a container shortage amid the Covid-19 buying boom. Flynn, who is also founding director at the Global Resilience Institute, noted that this is one of the challenges of a just-in-time system. Assembly lines will be idled because parts don't show up when they're expected, for example.\n\n\"It's never been stressed this badly before, and it's going to take a really long time, and they're just beginning the process of sorting it out ... you've essentially created this traffic jam that doesn't allow you just to reset and restart — you have to restack and reset the system and that's something that's going to take a lot of choreography,\" Flynn added. In the hunt for efficiency and low-cost goods, ships have become larger and larger. Not all ports can handle ships the size of the Ever Given, creating concentrated systems. Ships of this size might sail from China to Rotterdam — the path the Ever Given was on — where its containers might then be loaded onto smaller ships that sail to the rest of Europe or other destinations including the United States. In other words, smaller ports can't just absorb the scheduling conflicts created by the traffic jam at the Suez Canal. Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal during 2020, for an average of 51.5 per day, according to the Suez Canal Authority. By Monday morning, more than 350 vessels total were backed up on both ends of the Suez Canal, as the Ever Given cut off access in both directions. Shipping agent GAC said that traffic was expected to be back to normal in the next three to four days."}

Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\n\nWhen a mammoth ship became wedged in the Suez Canal, one thing was clear. The entire world needed it to move.\n\nHow the Ever Given was freed from the Suez Canal: A visual analysis\n\nThe crisis in the Suez Canal last month turned the world's attention on a single challenge few had ever considered: how to refloat a 200,000-ton mass of steel, as long as the Empire State Building is high.\n\nDigging, tugging and pulling, it turned out, freed the ship. The days-long, round-the-clock effort to move the massive vessel involved sucking sand and mud from underneath its hull, as tugboats pushed and pulled the ship in confluence with a swelling tide.\n\nHere's how it happened.\n\nYour browser does not support the video element. The Ever Given container ship became stuck at an angle in the Suez Canal during a sandstorm on March 23, blocking for six days a vital waterway through which about 15 percent of all shipping passes. Using satellite imagery and vessel data, The Post reconstructed the operation that released the ship. The canal narrows below the shoreline, which meant the ship was much more stuck than it appeared to be in photos. Riprap, or loosely placed stones, lines the banks, which made it even harder to dislodge the ship. A fleet of tugboats, dredgers and salvage crews worked for several days to refloat the ship. On Monday morning, they managed to free the stern, the back of the vessel, the most visible sign of progress since the blockage. After a morning boost from a high tide reaching nearly seven feet, a new attempt to release the Ever Given began Monday afternoon. The Ever Given was fully dislodged on Monday at 3:05 p.m. local time.\n\nThe Ever Given got stuck the morning of March 23, amid poor visibility and high winds in one of the narrower parts of the 120-mile canal. Egyptian officials have launched an investigation into the details of the crash.\n\n\"When you're traveling on a boat and you hit something, there's a tremendous sense of loss,\" said Gregory Tylawsky, a licensed shipmaster and founder of the Maritime Expert Group.\n\nEarly in the crisis, experts were unsure how they would be able to move the ship. \"It is not really possible to pull it loose,\" said Peter Berdowski, the CEO of Dutch dredging company Boskalis, which helped with the week's efforts.\n\nThe vessel, he said, was like \"an enormous beached whale.\"\n\nThe canal is dug in sand and mud, meaning a boat hitting the edge would get \"stuck in the sand rather than [getting] repelled by a hard wall,\" said Ragui Assaad, a professor at the University of Minnesota and research fellow at the Economic Research Forum in Cairo.\n\nThere is little room for error. \"As a pilot, you cannot deviate from that center line,\" Tylawsky said.\n\nWithin hours of the blockage, tugboats were on the scene, followed by dredgers, working through the week to free the Japanese-owned, Taiwanese-operated ship.\n\nDays in the making\n\nEach hour the Ever Given remained stuck on a muddy bank of the Suez Canal meant worse disruptions to international commerce. A substantial share of all shipping passes through the waterway. In the face of delays, the prices of oil and coffee began to rise, and livestock faced starvation aboard some of the hundreds of vessels left waiting indefinitely.\n\nWith a ship that size already caught in the canal's bank, there wouldn't be much for the operators to do.\n\n\"It'd be controlled chaos onboard,\" said Gary Cordes, a retired shipmaster and senior adviser at the Maritime Expert Group, who said he transited the canal nine times between the 1960s and 1980s. He said it would fall on those familiar with the landscape to come up with a plan to free the ship.\n\nAuthorities worked day and night, dredging and using tugboats to dig and pull the ship away from the banks. Salvagers dredged underneath and around the hull, pumping sediment from the bottom of the canal.\n\nThe dredgers on scene were heavy-duty. The 10th of Ramadan came to help, as did the Dutch-made Mashhour, owned and operated by the Suez Canal Authority, which was touted by the Transportation Research Board in 1996 as the \"world's largest and most powerful stationary cutter suction dredger,\" capable of sucking up \"abrasive sand with gravel, compacted sand, sticky clay and rocks.\"\n\nOften more than 10 tugboats were also leading the effort, pushing and pulling the ship in an effort to dislodge it from the bank.\n\nLoaders excavated the eastern embankment at the ship's bow. Over the weekend, those efforts removed nearly 1 million cubic feet of mud and water, officials said.\n\nIn an added effort to refloat the ship, some 9,000 tons of the Ever Given's ballast water — used to stabilize the ship — were released to help lighten the vessel, officials said.\n\nThe final moments\n\nWhile efforts throughout the week proved unsuccessful, the weekend bore promises of shifting tides. A full moon on Sunday night meant unusually high waters that could help refloat the ship. And more help was on the way: two big and powerful tugboats, the Dutch-flagged Alp Guard and the Italian-flagged Carlo Magno.\n\nThrough Sunday night into Monday afternoon, teams worked tirelessly to get enough of the sand and mud out from under the boat that it would rejoin the canal's waters, staving off a catastrophe for global trade.\n\nOn Monday afternoon around 3 p.m., the Ever Given broke free, its leviathan hull slowly creeping north to the Great Bitter Lake."}

The EVER ACE is the first of a series of 12 container ships ordered by Evergreen in China and South Korea shipyard and was officially delivered by the builder on July 29.\n\nThis monstrous floating box has a carrying capacity of 23,992 TEU, making it the largest such vessel in the world.

Around 1.2 billion tons passed through the canal on 19,000 ships in 2019 – roughly one eighth of all goods transported by sea that year.\n\nMillions of tons of manufactured goods make their way from China and South Asia to Europe via the canal. It's also a key route for oil tankers going to and from the Middle East.\n\nThe Ever Given has run aground at a busy time of year. Trade is picking up after the Chinese New Year which sees factories close down in the world's manufacturing powerhouse.\n\nBusinesses are seeking to restock in the hope that coronavirus restrictions will ease in the coming months.\n\nThere is already a global shortage of shipping container space and Covid-19 safety procedures have been causing delays at ports.\n\nWhat impact will the blockage have?\n\nDelays have already begun in the hours following the incident. About 42 vessels seeking to travel northbound and 64 southbound are now waiting, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe longer the Ever Given is stuck the more that number will rise. Around 10 million barrels of oil and petrol are reportedly backed up near the entrances of the canal.\n\nChris Evans, international supply chain expert at Colliers International, was confident the Ever Given would be moved quickly, meaning delays to goods shipments would be minimised.\n\n\"If it doesn't get cleared quickly it will cause a lot of delay and people will have to start looking at shipping goods via the Cape of Good Hope,\" he said.\n\n\"It will cause a hiccup and bunching of ships at various ports in Europe. Anything that's behind it will come rushing through. Discharging vessels is already slow because of Covid procedures, as is pick-up of containers.\n\nHe added: \"The knock-on effect, the delays, start to build very quickly. We will have to go back to that old-fashioned thing: patience.\"\n\nWhile most ships are at sea for weeks and can absorb a couple of days of delay, a backlog at ports can cause issues rapidly, Mr Evans said.\n\n\"Only modern ports like London and Thames Gateway can cope with it. Volume soon builds up, it doesn't take long.\n\nHowever, he was sanguine about the impact on businesses and consumers. \"I wouldn't have thought there's any major cost impact for businesses. We should not worry too much about gaps in supplies of products.\"\n\nSamir Madani at TankerTrackers told the Financial Times: \"The canal is a key chokepoint for global trade.\n\n\"If they can free the vessel quickly then the impact will be minimised but any prolonged blockage would have severe consequences, from affecting oil prices and shipping rates to forcing container vessels to take the much longer route around Africa.\""}

Images showed the ship's bow was touching the eastern wall, while its stern looked lodged against the western wall — an extraordinary event that experts said they had never heard of happening before in the canal's 150-year history.\n\nTugboats strained Wednesday to try to nudge the obstruction out of the way as ships hoping to enter the waterway began lining up in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.

About 12% of global trade dependent on effective transit through the Suez Canal which provides the shortest connection between Asia and Europe. Growing concerns have been raised about the effect of the World's largest maritime hold-up on the global economy, and Nigeria may not be left out.\n\nThe Suez Canal can be seen as a major artery to global trade, and with the effects of the Covid19 pandemic still wearing off, the world may not be able to afford continuous interruptions to globalization. The Ever Given cargo ship is substantially bigger than the Eiffel tower and the empire state building. The ship is 400 meters long and wedged diagonally across a canal that is not more than 200metres wide.\n\nIn 2017, a Japanese container vessel blocked the canal due to some mechanical issues by which the response from the Egyptian authorities was swift in developing tug boats to rectify the situation, in hours. However, regular measures have yielded sub-optimal results. According to the Suez Canal authorities, nearly 9000 ships pass through the canal in 2020, averaging 51.5 ships per day.\n\nInformation contained in a Bloomberg report reveals the breakthrough in the rescue attempt came after diggers removed 27,000 cubic meters of sand, going deep into the banks of the canal. The authorities noted that while the ship is floating again, it wasn't immediately clear how soon the waterway would be open to traffic. Nigeria is a highly import-dependent consuming economy with a large percentage of its revenue dependent on oil export, may find herself susceptible to globalization shocks.\n\nNairametrics had a chat with the Vice President and Head of Trade & Marine Operations, Gladius Commodities Limited, Okojie Larry on the impact of the blockage on the Nigerian economy he said, \"For Nigeria as a country that is dependent largely on imports, we could experience a further rise in prices in goods in general, i.e., clothes, food, oil produce, etc. due to delays or inability for vessels to sail to their destination\".\n\nLarry also suggests that clearing the Suez Canal blockage may take a while, saying- \"This could take days or weeks at most. Companies will lose money as goods won't be able to get to final consumers. Increase in demurrage leads to a high cost of the product. For a supplier that has a fixed price, the deal might end up being losing transaction. We will also experience a higher cost of freight as vessels/ships will have to take the longer route. Here, stakeholders in the maritime industry will therefore take advantage of the price hike.\"\n\nOpeoluwa Dapo-Thomas, Private Oil Market Trader affirmed the Suez Canal blockage impact on the Nigerian economy but suggests that it may be negligible- \"Geographically, the Suez Canal might be far away from Nigeria but Nigerian imports and exports which might follow that route will be delayed. But this is an issue where majority of the brunt will be on vessel owners and insurance companies. As it is a short-term hassle, there's little effect it can have on the Nigerian economy\".\n\nHe also speculates that \"companies that will benefit are those who can find faster routes or ways to deliver but it is a difficult arbitrage opportunity to profit from. The losers are insurance companies and consumers and sellers of the goods currently stuck. To evade that route through The Cape of good hope will require more expenses and time.\""}

It had nothing to do with my fear of vulnerability or difficulty asking for help; in fact, it had nothing to do with me at all.\n\nHad she seen the stuck boat?\n\nThe boat, of course, is the Ever Given, a massive container ship operated by the Taiwan-based shipping company Evergreen, which probably now wishes its name wasn't painted on the boat's sides in such enormous letters. On its way from China to Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, the boat accidentally Tokyo drifted to a stop in Egypt's Suez Canal on Tuesday, where it has been stuck sideways ever since. Efforts to refloat the Ever Given so far have been futile; the heavy construction equipment and fleet of industrial-strength tugboats assigned to that job have been successful not at dislodging the ship's bow from the canal's sandy shore, but at demonstrating this big-ass boat's stupendous girth in photos. The ship, which is longer than the Empire State Building is tall, looms over literally everything—construction equipment, palm trees, nearby buildings. The Ever Given is Manute Bol to the human world's Muggsy Bogues.\n\nMy therapist had not seen the boat, even though photos of it had already begun to be manufactured into memes about life's existential problems and the stupid little things we all do to feel some control over them. I asked her to Google it in front of me, because I had become obsessed. Since Tuesday afternoon, in fact, I have thought about little else. The first photos I saw of it were taken by workers on the Maersk Denver, the ship that was immediately behind the Ever Given when a wind storm is suspected to have blown her sideways. (Yes, the boats are girls.) I spent much of yesterday hunting down photos of the boat, both in situ and in happier times. I acquainted myself with websites like VesselFinder and MarineTraffic, as well as with the concept of Suezmax and the phrase bulbous bow, which the Ever Given has and which means that she is not just on top of the sand, but also lodged inside it.\n\nI'm obsessed with the dang boat because people like me and you are not really supposed to be aware of what boats like her are up to. You're not supposed to think about, or even notice, global freight, but the Ever Given has made cartoonishly noticeable some of the crucial infrastructure of global capital, which is usually invisible in most people's daily life.

Peruse the surrounding waterways on any of the internet's maritime trackers, and you'll find the beginnings of a far more significant problem: More than 150 other absolutely huge shipping vessels, transporting everything from live animals to crude oil, are waiting on either side; the barge ran aground at a point where the Suez has only one lane, which means that traffic is blocked in both directions."}

If the Ever Given is still aground and cannot operate normally, we will not pay the rent,\" a company official told the Taipei Times by telephone.\n\nWhether Evergreen would seek compensation from the ship owner would depend on the cause of the incident, and it would make the decision after an investigation is completed, it added.\n\nLuster Maritime, which is headquartered in Panama and a unit of Japan's Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd, provides sea freight transportation services.\n\nThe incident left dozens of ships gridlocked as they attempted to transit between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.\n\nEfforts to free the ship had so far proceeded faster than initial warnings that traffic could be choked off for days.\n\nThe 193km-long Suez Canal is among the most trafficked waterways in the world, used by tankers shipping crude from the Middle East to Europe and North America.\n\nAbout 12 percent of global trade and 8 percent of liquefied natural gas pass through the canal, as do about 1 million barrels of oil per day.\n\nThe Ever Given was grounded early on Tuesday amid poor visibility caused by a dust storm and wind speeds that reached 40 knots, resulting in a \"loss of the ability to steer the ship,\" the canal authority said.\n\nAbout 42 vessels either in the northbound convoy or arriving to transit the canal in that direction were waiting for the Ever Given to be refloated, Leth Agencies, one of the top providers of Suez Canal crossing services, said in a notice to clients.\n\nThe company said that it was sending a dredger to help free the ship."}

Clinton was given the Secret Service codename \"Evergreen\" when her husband Bill Clinton was president.\n\nThe ship's call sign is H3RC—the same three letters as the initials of the 2016 presidential candidate.\n\nOn the Telegram encrypted messaging app, a QAnon account with more than 106,000 subscribers wrote: \"Suez Canal blocked by huge container ship named Evergreen. Evergreen shipping is most likely a cover for human and sex trafficking.\n\n\"HRC = Hillary Rodham Clinton. Evergreen = Hillary's Secret Service name. Evergreen Call Sign: H3RC.\"\n\nAnother influential QAnon advocate with more than 53,000 subscribers on the \"free speech\" social network Gab wrote: \"Evergreen is HRC's Secret Service name. It has also been speculated that Evergreen shipping is a front for human trafficking.\n\n\"Theory: ship gets stuck, International aid offered, containers opened on live TV.\"\n\nQAnon supporters often twist world events to suit their theories or claim they have been predicted by the mysterious figure known as \"Q.\"\n\nFor years, \"Q\" would leave cryptic messages on messageboard sites, which were deciphered to form the basis of the conspiracy theorists' beliefs. These include the notion that leading Democrats and members of the Hollywood elite are child-eating pedophiles.\n\nThe first of these so-called \"Qdrops\" appeared on 4chan in October 2017, claiming that Clinton would soon be arrested.\n\nFor the next few years, thousands of the posts appeared online, often using phrases that became QAnon slogans.\n\nNo new messages have been posted for months, however, with their frequency slowing down considerably since former President Donald Trump, a savior-like figure for QAnon, lost the election in November.\n\nThe conspiracy theorists do not necessarily need new posts to guide the movement, however. They simply reinterpret the existing catalog of messages to suit their purpose.\n\nIn this case, the attempt to move the ship from the Suez Canal was predicted because \"Q\" had previously mentioned Evergreen and the words \"when do you need a plumber?\" in an April 2018 post.\n\n\"When do you call a plumber?

A southbound convoy is also blocked, it said.\n\nThe passage accounts for approximately 30% of container ship traffic globally each day, according to Reuters, with the alternative shipping route between Asia and Europe – navigating around the African cape – taking a week longer.\n\nNearly 19,000 ships, or an average of 51.5 ships per day, with a net tonnage of 1.17 billion tonnes passed through the canal during 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority.\n\nMaersk, the world's largest container shipping company said seven of its container vessels have been affected by the blockage, with four of its vessels stuck in the canal system while the rest are waiting to enter the passage, the Danish company said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nRe-floating the massive container vessel is \"technically very complicated\" and could take days, a senior canal pilot at the Suez Canal Authority told CNN.\n\nThe official – who spoke on condition of anonymity as he's not authorized to speak to the media – said that the equipment to float a ship is available but it depends on how it is used.\n\n\"If the method is not correct it might take a week, and if it's done well it might take two days. But if it had been correct [in the first place], then the crisis could have ended yesterday,\" the pilot said.\n\nThe official said that, due to the damage, the Ever Given is unlikely to be able to sail now and will probably need to be towed to the nearest parking site, the Great Bitter Lake District, about 30 kilometers to the north.\n\nAfterwards it will likely be towed with its cargo to the nearest port – either Sokhna port 20 kilometers south of the city of Suez, or Port Said, 100 kilometers to the north. There the cargo would be offloaded and the ship would undergo minor repairs. If the damage turns out to be more serious, the vessel would be towed to a marine shipyard.\n\nThe official said that \"at present, the number of ships waiting could reach 100, which will increase over time.\"\n\n\"The disruption of navigation is expected to cause ship congestion, which takes two to three days to normally restore traffic order,\" he added.\n\nThe impact on oil and gas flows will depend on how long it takes to clear the container ship, industry sources told Reuters."}

After getting caught up in high winds, the Evergreen Marine Corporation's Ever Given wedged itself rather firmly in the Suez Canal, disrupting an estimated 12 per cent of global trade in the process (via The Guardian). Not so funny for the captain or the hundreds of ships waiting in line to get through the canal, perhaps.\n\nStill, it gave many of us a good chuckle, and the boat has at last been freed - opening up the canal and world trade once more. Yet the infamous boat now lives on in digital form, as Microsoft Flight Simulator modders have been hard at work adding it to the game.\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator - United Kingdom & Ireland World Update Microsoft Flight Simulator - United Kingdom & Ireland World Update\n\nMade by FlyBoyRez1 (and inspired by the work of Zepingouin35), the Suez Traffic Jam mod does exactly what it says on the tin... which is plonk a big old boat in the middle of the canal. Traffic will also appear around the boat from both sides, and you'll find some boats parked in the Suez Gulf. Several tug boats will try to free the ship (in vain), and you can also recreate that digger meme thanks to the inclusion of a pair of excavators.\n\nNaturally, as soon as something appears in Microsoft Flight Sim, players try to land a plane on it - and YouTuber Bill4LE has already attempted to do so. Unfortunately it seems you simply fly through the ship when attempting to land, but the video still provides a nice look at the mod and sheer scale of the boat:\n\nTo install this mod for yourself, simply head over to the mod page on Flight Sim.io to download it. You'll also need a couple of prerequisite mods, including Global AI Ship Traffic by Henrik Nielsen, and Dave's Crooked Library for the digger. Which is essential, in my book.\n\nFrom browsing Reddit over the last few days, however, it seems Microsoft Flight Sim isn't the only game to have been blessed with the big old boat. Someone appears to have created a version of it in Rust, while another modder has made an old-world version of the Ever Given in Valheim. Time to get the ores out."}

The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it had lost the ability to steer amid high winds and a dust storm.\n\nEight tugboats were working to free the vessel, blocking a lane key to Asia-Europe trade through which about 50 ships a day passed in 2019, according to Egyptian government statistics.\n\nGAC, a Dubai-based marine services company, said the Ever Given had been partially refloated and moved alongside the canal bank, citing information from the SCA.\n\n\"Convoys and traffic are expected to resume as soon as the vessel is towed to another position,\" GAC said on its website.\n\nBernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the ship's technical manager, said it ran aground in the canal at about 0540 GMT on Tuesday.\n\nEgyptian forecasters said high winds and a sandstorm hit the area on Tuesday, with winds gusting as much as 31mph.\n\nBSM said all crew were safe and accounted for, and there had been no reports of injuries or pollution.\n\nA growing number of tankers were gathering near the entrance to the canal on Wednesday morning waiting to pass through. Seven vessels carrying 6.3m barrels of crude oil were among those unable to pass, the research firm Kpler said, with another three carrying an additional 2.5m barrels scheduled to try to make the passage by the end of the week.\n\nThe accident was probably due in part to strong winds that turned the containers above deck into a vast sail that blew the vessel off course, said Jamil Sayegh, a former captain and maritime law specialist with experience navigating the canal. \"The force generated by the wind would have unintentionally altered the heading of the vessel,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that human error may also have been a factor since ships traverse the canal in convoys and none of the vessels behind the Ever Given had run into similar troubles.\n\n\"Ships are machines run by propulsion engines with rudders that are almost identical in all vessels. The variables on board are the software and the personnel.\"\n\nVessels passing through the Suez are obligated to use Egyptian pilots to help them navigate the stretch, he said.\n\nWeather forecasts would have shown that winds were strong on Wednesday, but he said both canal authorities and mariners tried not to delay passage.\n\n\"If you delay this vessel at Suez anchorage, it means you are making the ship owner to lose $60,000 [£44,000] per day or $3-4000 per hour of delay,\" said Sayegh, the Beirut agent for the shipping journal Lloyd's.\n\nThe incentive not to pause journeys had grown more acute with the rise of just-in-time supply chains in recent decades, said Peter Sand, the chief shipping analyst with Bimco, an international association for shipowners.\n\n\"For decades shipping has been the invisible conveyor belt at sea, enabling large manufacturing industries like automative to do just-in-time shipments, even though from time to time shippers are calling foul in terms of the reliability of the schedule,\" he said. \"Some production lines may be halted due to containers being caught in traffic like this.\"\n\nLars Jensen, the chief executive of SeaIntelligence Consulting, said delays increased the risk of congestion at European ports. \"When the canal reopens, this will mean that the delayed cargo will now arrive at the same time as cargo behind it which is still on track,\" he said.\n\nThe Ever Given is one of a new category of ships called ultra-large container ships (ULCS), some of which are even too big for the Panama canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific. It is carrying hundreds of containers bound for Rotterdam from China."}

But still the ship veered from one side of the channel to the other. Each time he turned the wheel, the helmsman was able to bring the ship temporarily back toward the correct heading, but too-aggressive rudder commands caused it to overshoot the mark. Instead of settling down, the ship's swings were getting wilder.\n\nAt 7:38 a.m., as it approached the irrigated fruit-tree groves of the Al Ganayen district, the Ever Given veered toward the left bank, skimmed alongside it, then jerked hard to the right. The overcorrection was so severe that the bow swung toward the opposite bank like a harpoon. This time there was neither time nor room to undo the swerve. The bulb-shaped tip of Ever Given's bow plunged 50 feet deep into the mud and sand of the canal bank. Maintaining its momentum, the stern swung around toward the far bank until it, too, was firmly lodged.\n\nKanthavel's reaction: \"Shit.\"\n\nHalf a mile behind, on the bridge of the container ship Maersk Denver, marine engineer Julianne Cona aimed her camera forward and snapped an image of the Ever Given's hull stretching from bank to bank. \"From the looks of it,\" she wrote on Instagram, \"that ship is super stuck.\"\n\nEveryone wanted to know how it happened and who was to blame. It wasn't merely a craving for lurid details; understanding how accidents happen is essential to making sure they don't happen again. This is why around the world, transportation safety agencies carry out investigations and issue recommendations for rule changes. Egypt's, unfortunately, does not have a great track record. Accidents that occur under its purview tend to be enmeshed in intrigue and controversy. More than 1,000 of the 1,400 ferry passengers on the al-Salam Boccaccio 98 died when it sank in the Red Sea in 2006. The government initially blamed the captain, but a subsequent parliamentary investigation laid the blame on the ferry's owner, Mamdouh Ismail, a businessman and politician with close ties to then president Hosni Mubarak. Acquitted in a 2008 trial, he was later retried, convicted, and sentenced to seven years in prison, though he never served time, and the conviction was later erased.\n\nWith the Ever Given, the Egyptian government evinced no doubt as to who was responsible. Within hours, it declared, with no evidence, that the ship had run aground due to an engine failure. After it became clear that this was not true, Egypt asserted that the captain was to blame for sailing at such high speed. In response, the ship's insurers issued a statement pointing out that when a ship is traveling through the canal in a convoy its speed \"is controlled by the Suez Canal pilots and SCA vessel traffic management services.\"\n\nThe pilot would get on board and the first thing he would do is ask for a couple of cartons of cigarettes. The electricians are going to want a carton. And the tugboats, if you need tugboats, they're going to want that carton. It just goes on and on.\n\nNevertheless, the canal authority filed a legal claim demanding $916.5 million from the ship's owners, citing, among other things, the cost of salvaging the boat and the damage to Egypt's international reputation. Maritime legal experts were skeptical about the basis for this claim. \"They're obviously just sort of thinking up numbers,\" said Martin Davies, head of Tulane University's Maritime Law Center."}

In this conversation with SupplyChainBrain Editor-in-Chief Bob Bowman, Joe Klobus, claims and insurance manager with global freight forwarder OEC Group, discusses how the incident brought to light the concept of general average, a centuries-old law that requires shippers to share the losses from such an event.\n\nSCB: What is general average?\n\nKlobus: In short, it's the equitable sharing of a loss between the vessel owners and cargo interests. When the vessel encounters a peril that fits within the York Antwerp Rules, the vessel owners are able to declare general average, which would spread that loss across the cargo interests.\n\nSCB: In what kind of situations has this previously been invoked?\n\nKlobus: General average is often invoked for vessel fires or containers going overboard as a sacrifice. However, it's not commonly known that it doesn't apply to just that limited scope of events. It can also apply to salvage, to towing expenses, and for seeking refuge in a port or harbor. It's much broader than people typically know.\n\nSCB: So in a hypothetical situation where the carrier is found to be at fault, it couldn't invoke general average?\n\nKlobus: That's not true. If the carrier is at fault for a situation and it fits within the realm of the York Antwerp Rules, it can declare general average. And, generally speaking, the carriers aren't responsible when they do declare general average. Of course, this can lead to lengthy litigation, but the law generally supports their stance.\n\nSCB: Is Evergreen invoking it in the Suez incident?\n\nKlobus: It's actually the owners of the vessel who invoked general average — Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd."}

Most of the posts began with the same sentence: \"Over a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies have been rescued out of shipping containers in the Suez Canal by US Navy Seals.\" The story referenced the Evergreen cargo ship Ever Given, which became stuck in the Suez Canal in March and caused a major maritime traffic jam that took days to clear after the ship was freed.\n\nThe source of the text appeared to be Before It's News, a dubious website that has consistently published content not rooted in facts. For example, the unreliable website once falsely claimed Pope Francis had been found guilty of child trafficking and murder.\n\nRegarding the Ever Given ship and the purported U.S. Navy SEALs rescue, the full story on Before It's News bore the headline: \"Trafficked Children, Bodies, Weapons Found on Evergreen Ship Blocking Suez Canal.\" In addition to being posted on Facebook, the misleading content was also shared on TikTok.\n\nThe introduction of the article read as follows:\n\nOver a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies have been rescued out of shipping containers in the Suez Canal by US Navy Seals. Sources say that as of this writing, children were still being rescued and bodies discovered in Evergreen's 18,000+ containers. The containers were on an Evergreen Corporation ship that blocked the Canal from Tues. 23 March to Mon 29 March, causing billions in lost revenue to shipping companies internationally. The Seals also found Weapons of Mass Destruction on the six story high vessel – which were believed destined to start a war in the Middle East. Finally by Tues. the Evergreen cargo ship was loosened and taken to Bitter Lake in Egypt. By order of the Egyptian President, the containers were taken off the ship and searched by US Navy Seals. The Japanese-owned, Taiwanese-operated ship of Evergreen Corporation was actually co-owned by Walmart and the Clinton Foundation – known for it's international child trafficking ring. The children were said ordered out of magazines like Wayfair by pedophiles who paid big bucks for certain abused children.\n\nThe rest of the article mentioned \"weapons of mass destruction\" and included a purported \"telegram\" that read: \"Ever Given has been boarded by the US Navy Seals and they have opened several cargo containers with live and dead inside. The vessel is in Bitter Lake and the Navy is performing unloading procedures. No images will be leaked, but I have been sent one.\"\n\nThe entire story was false.\n\nOne Facebook user who shared the baseless article posted: \"YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP!!\" That was also false.\n\nNot one credible news publisher across the world reported anything similar. If such a story had any basis in fact, it is unlikely that coverage of the massive breaking news event would be limited to a single obscure website that had a history of publishing false and misleading content.\n\nThe mention of the Clinton Foundation in the story might remind readers of a somewhat similar, debunked claim involving former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Ever Given cargo ship."}

That's exactly what Suez Canal officials are doing in the aftermath of the giant container ship that blocked the international shipping lane for six days.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Egypt \"plans to widen and deepen the southern part of the Suez Canal where a hulking vessel ran aground and closed off the crucial waterway in March.\" Business Insider reported that, \"In a televised address on Tuesday the head of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Osama Rabie, said an 18.6 mile stretch of the waterway would be widened by about 131 feet (40 meters) and deepened by 32 feet (10 meters) to improve the movement of ships in the area.\"\n\nA Top Priority\n\nWhen companies and organizations have recovered from a crisis, one of the first things they should do is to carefully review the cause of the crisis, then implement reforms or changes to help ensure the same situation is not repeated.\n\nStarbucks apparently did the right thing in 2018 in the wake of a headline-making crisis. The manager of one of their cafes in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had two black men arrested who were waiting for a colleague. A few weeks later, the company closed 8,000 restaurants in the U.S. for a day so that 175,000 employees could receive anti-bias training.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has been criticized over the years for the handling of their own crisis situations.\n\nIn a story yesterday on CBS's Sunday Morning, correspondent Jim Axelrod reported on the publication of Zero Fail: The Rise and Fall of the Secret Service. The book by Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig is critical of the agency and how it has responded to its crises.\n\nIn response to a request for comment for this story, the agency said, \"The U.S. Secret Service is aware of an upcoming book which re-hashes past challenges the agency overcame and evolved from. Now and throughout its 156 year history, the agency's skilled workforce is dedicated to the successful execution of its critical protective and investigative missions.\"\n\nAmong those interviewed in the CBS story was former Agent Jonathan Wackrow, who was with the Secret Service for 14 years where he served on the details protecting President and Mrs. Obama. Axelrod said Wackrow's experience, \"... gives him insight into another problem plaguing the Secret Service that more money can't address: a culture lacking transparency and accountability.\"\n\nAccording to a transcript of the story, \"On November 11, 2011, a man fired a rifle at the White House, striking the building seven times. The Obamas weren't home, but their daughters were. Despite agents reporting gunfire, Leonnig writes they were told by superiors to stand down. Secret Service leadership initially told no one – not their agents, not the public, not even President and Mrs. Obama.\n\n\"Thankfully, [it] didn't have a tragic outcome. But afterwards? Nothing,\" said Wackrow. \"There was no, 'Hey, let's get everybody together and let's review what happened.'\"\n\n\"Axelrod asked, \"But how could there not be?\"\n\n\"The Secret Service is the best organization in the world in crisis management. Yet, they can't manage themselves,\" Wackrow replied. \"It was an embarrassment, but you have to learn from it.\"\n\nSecret Service Responds\n\nIn response to a request to comment on the CBS story, the Secret Service provided a link to a report by the National Academy of Public Administration. The agency said in a statement that, \"The Academy Panel determined that the U.S. Secret Service has taken significant, wide-ranging, and important actions.\"\n\nSubstantial Changes Made\n\n\"Specifically, the agency has made a substantial number of organizational, policy, and process changes to transform the way it does business; professionalize administrative, technical, and management functions; and address numerous staffing and employee issues. Agency leadership has made these changes in a relatively short time, demonstrating a strong commitment to change.\""}

Rabie said the figure is based on canal revenue losses, the cost of equipment and machinery, and the manpower hours for the 800 rescuers who freed the ship. \"We will ask for a fair amount,\" Rabie said, according to a NBC News translation, without specifying who might be liable to pay. \"We saved them so much by rescuing the ship without any major damage or losses,\" he added. \"The whole ship could've been lost.\" The 200,000 ton mega-container carrier was successfully refloated on Monday, six days after coming stuck sideways in the Suez Canal. The incident sparked a crisis in international shipping, held up $9 billion in global trade a day and left 422 vessels carrying everything from crude oil to cattle waiting to pass. Authorities said the backlog would be cleared by Saturday, but the maritime traffic jam could have long lasting repercussions on ports and supply chains worldwide. Rabie said he hoped a compensation agreement could be reached \"in two or three days\" and if not, Egypt might hold the ship in the Great Bitter Lake, north of the Suez Canal, where it is currently undergoing maintenance checks. \"We could agree on a certain compensation, or it goes to court,\" he said. \"If they decide to go to court, then the ship should be held,\" he warned."}

The two sides seem a long way away from resolving the issue.\n\nAnd caught in the middle of this legal battle is the cargo, with an estimated value of some $1bn, the owners of which have no say.\n\nIndeed, North European importers with containers onboard the Ever Given may have already decided to abandon the cargo, due to the time-sensitive nature of product, contracts of sale being frustrated and/or markets having been lost.\n\nSingapore-based Mathu Jagannath, director of marine claims consultancy firm NAU Pte, has urged SCA and shipowner to consider the cargo interests.\n\n\"The longer this saga continues, the greater will be the losses arising out of the incident,\" he said. \"We urge all the parties to consider all the options available to deal with this issue, including the release of the vessel from arrest so it can continue with its voyage.\"\n\nHe also recommended that cargo interests be \"proactive and participate\" in any action relating to the release of the ship.\n\nThe SCA blames the accident on the ship's \"excessive speed\" at the time of the grounding, while the vessel's insurer, the UK's P&I Club, maintains that navigation in the waterway was under the control of the SCA's pilots and vessel traffic management.\n\nThe P&I Club said these controls included the speed of the transit and the availability of tugs.\n\nThe shipowner has declared General Average, meaning cargo owners must pay a percentage of the value of their consignment towards the salvage costs before the release of containers, but the process cannot be completed until the ship is able to discharge its boxes.\n\nAccording to vesselsvalue, the 2018-built Ever Given is worth $183m, having increased its value by around $13m since it ran aground by keeping with spiralling asset values in the container sector.\n\nIt is not known whether its operator, Evergreen, which has leased the vessel on a long-term charter, is still paying daily hire, although one broker source said he thought the carrier would still be responsible for the charter, despite the ship being under arrest.\n\nMoreover, with containership capacity in such short supply and demand remaining high, Evergreen will be keen to get the ship back into service as soon as possible."}

Then this plan is for you.\n\nEven with the Ever Given now slowly moving again, the live animals inside the blistering cargo containers, which are quickly running out of feed and water, are now nearing an even more tragic end than that which awaits them in the slaughterhouses at their destination.\n\nEven if the ships were to resume full course today, the water and food would not last until their sea journey is over.\n\nRomania is the source for the 130,000 of the 200,000 live animals now caught in the Suez bottleneck.\n\nSome six of the 11 ships full to the brim with the live animals from the South-Eastern European nation are in a particularly critical situation. They were supposed to reach harbours in the Persian Gulf over four days ago, but still have not left the Canal.\n\nAccording to EU law, ships carrying live animals need to load 25 percent more food than planned for their trip in case of delays, but animal welfare organisations warned that this rarely happens.\n\nMeanwhile, Păun explained to EUobserver that even with the 25 percent buffer, these ships would now run out of animal feed long before they arrive in port.\n\n\"A ship that left Romania on 16 March was scheduled to arrive in Jordan on 23 March, but instead it would now reach port on 1 April at the earliest. That is a nine-day delay. Even if the ship had the required 25 percent additional animal feed, it would only have lasted for 1.5 days\", he said.\n\nThe 'ANSVSA', the Romanian authority in charge of live-animal exports issued a press release two days ago saying that after reaching out to those in charge on board the ships, there is enough food and water to last a few days.\n\nThe press release added that live animal exports have been currently suspended until the situation in the Suez is dealt with.\n\nBut for Păun, those responsible for the shipment would never admit that animals are dying by the thousands on their vessels.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU legislation does not compel an EU member state to report on animal mortality on board these ships and Romania would never release that information voluntarily because authorities know that it would lead to investigations, he added.\n\nRomania is one of Europe's largest live-sheep exporters and has several times been singled out by the European Commission for its bad practices regarding live-animal exports.\n\nLast year, Romania was red-flagged by Brussels for failing to meet live-animal transport conditions after more than 14,000 sheep drowned when a cargo vessel capsized off the Black Sea coast.\n\nA year earlier, the then EU commissioner for food safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, urged Romania - to no avail - to stop the export of 70,000 live sheep to the Persian Gulf because temperatures inside the cargo vessel exceed 60 degrees Celsius.\n\nInstead, Romanian authorities increased their live-animal exports, despite an investigation that showed animals exported to Gulf countries dying from the high temperatures, being unloaded violently off ships, squeezed into car trunks, and slaughtered by unskilled butchers.\n\nPăun says the only chance now for some of the animals to make it to destination alive is for Egyptian authorities to move quickly and clear the ships trapped in the Suez.\n\n\"I am appalled that legislation did not offer Romania the power to command cargo ships to return back home. Romania should have used diplomatic pressure to resolve the issue,\" he said.\n\n\"According to a ruling by the European Court of Justice, the EU member state exporting live animals to a third party country is responsible for their wellbeing until reaching destination\", he added."}

It's potential catastrophic delays.\n\n\"Ten per cent of the world's trade goes through the Suez Canal and you average about 50 vessels a day and we're in the second day of not being able to move any vessels.\n\nSuez Canal The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe and is one of the world's most heavily used shipping lanes. On average 50 vessels per day pass along the canal, although at times the number can be much higher. The canal is 120 miles long, 672ft wide and 78ft deep meaning it can handle the world's biggest ships, which take around 11 hours to pass through. Ships have been grounded in the canal before and in 2017 a Japanese ship became stuck but was re-floated within hours. The first canal was dug under the reign of Senausret III, Pharaoh of Egypt, who reigned from 1887-1849BC. A new artificial waterway was planned by French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps, which took 10 years to complete and opened in November 1869. Egypt nationalised the canal in 1956, prompting an invasion by shareholders Britain and France along with Israel. The Suez Crisis ended only after Egypt sank 40 ships in the canal and the United States, Soviet Union and United Nations intervened, forcing Britain, France and Israel to withdraw. The state-owned Suez Canal Authority was established in July 1956 and runs the waterway. In 2015 Egypt extended the Suez Canal providing ships with a 22 mile channel parallel channel, allowing more vessels to use it.\n\n\"Shipping companies are going to have to make a decision fairly soon whether or not to route the vessels around Africa, which adds and additional 12-14 days.\"\n\nDr Mercogliano, a former merchant mariner and associate professor of history at North Carolinas Campbell University, said the situation of a ship blocking the entire canal has never been faced before.\n\n\"There have been groundings on the Suez Canal before but never one of a ship this size or so dramatic - literally shutting the whole canal down by crossing the entire width of the canal,\" he said.\n\nHe appeared to contradict the owner's explanation for the incident that a gust of wind blew vessel of course, saying loss of power was probably to blame.\n\n\"According to the ship's agent, the ship lost power,\" he said.\n\n\"They literally said ship went 'dark' and in that scenario they would not only propulsion but also the rudder controls and it appears the vessel veered to the right and went ashore on the eastern bank.\n\n\"And because of the length of the vessel, it's one of the largest ships in the world, she's an ultra large container vessel, she actually ran aground on the eastern bank. You can see part of her bow is out of the water.\"\n\nHe said that if they ship can't immediately be re-floated then a more complex operation will begin - but that's unlikely to be quick.\n\n\"If they can't get her off with tugs they will have to start removing fuel off her and then the containers,\" he said.\n\n\"But the difficulty with getting the containers off her is that she's so tall it would be very difficult to get the correct sized cranes in there to get those off.\""}

As services are being restored, questions are being asked about what caused the outage, and why it took so long to fix.\n\nWhy did Facebook go down?\n\nJust before 5pm UTC, people began noticing they could not access Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger. It would be more than five hours before services would begin to be restored.\n\nFacebook issued a statement on Tuesday confirming that the cause of the outage was a configuration change to the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between the company's data centres, which had a cascading effect, bringing all Facebook services to a halt.\n\nIt meant not only was Facebook gone, but everything Facebook runs disappeared too.\n\nOthers have provided a bit more detail on why Facebook vanished from the internet.\n\nCloudflare – which had its own recent internet outage issues – has provided a detailed explanation about what happened.\n\nIt involves two things that sort out how the internet is the internet – that is Domain Name System (DNS) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).\n\nThe internet is a lot of connected networks. A lot. So that means to keep order of things, you need something like BGP to tell you where you need to go. DNS is essentially the address system for the location of each website – its IP address – while BGP is the roadmap that finds the most efficient way to get to that IP address.\n\nCloudflare said Facebook on Monday essentially told BGP through a series of updates that those paths to Facebook no longer existed. But not just for Facebook, everything Facebook runs. That meant people trying to reach Facebook couldn't find the path to access it.\n\nWhy were Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp down?\n\nAll of Facebook's services were affected, not just Facebook. It included Facebook's own internal systems, with reports staff were locked out of offices, and could not access their own internal communications platform.\n\nWhy did it take so long to fix?\n\nFacebook's own internal systems are run from the same place so it was hard for employees to diagnose and resolve the problem.\n\nAs the Guardian's UK technology editor, Alex Hern, put it on Twitter, \"Facebook runs EVERYTHING through Facebook\", so the usual way you would fix a problem like this was also not working.\n\nFacebook staff were reportedly unable to access their own communications platform, Workplace, and were unable to access their office due to the security pass system being caught up in the outage.\n\nFacebook indicated the duration and severity of the outage meant the systems were being brought back to full capacity slowly.\n\nHow did they eventually fix it?\n\nFacebook so far has not gone into much detail about what went wrong and how it was fixed, but there were multiple reports the social media giant sent a technical team out to its servers in California to manually reset the servers where the problem originated.\n\nCan this sort of outage be avoided in future?\n\nThis one is fairly uncommon but not something that can be completely avoided.

The FTC first sued Facebook in December 2020 over its allegedly anticompetitive practices, along with 48 state attorneys general who filed their own separate lawsuit. Both lawsuits were struck down in federal court in June, and while the states' lawsuit was struck down in its entirety—the judge ruled it had been brought too late—the FTC's lawsuit was dismissed \"without prejudice,\" clearing the way for the federal government to file it again. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg dismissed the FTC's case because he said their arguments for why Facebook is a monopoly were \"light on specific factual allegations,\" writing the lawsuit was \"legally insufficient and must therefore be dismissed\" even as the judge acknowledged he \"does not agree with all of Facebook's contentions here.\" The FTC said in a statement it believes the 80-page amended complaint adequately addresses those issues, adding \"additional data and evidence\" and \"detailed statistics\" about Facebook's allegedly monopolistic behavior. Facebook said in a statement Thursday it's \"unfortunate...the FTC has chosen to continue this meritless lawsuit,\" arguing there was \"no valid claim\" to say \"Facebook was a monopolist\" when the case was first dismissed \"and that has not changed.\"\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"Facebook's course of conduct has eliminated nascent rivals and extinguished the possibility that such rivals' independent existence might allow other internet platforms to overcome the substantial barriers to entry that protect Facebook's monopoly position,\" the complaint states. \"In doing so, Facebook deprives personal social networking users in the United States of the benefits of competition, including increased choice, quality, and innovation.\"\n\nChief Critic\n\n\"The FTC's claims are an effort to rewrite antitrust laws and upend settled expectations of merger review, declaring to the business community that no sale is ever final,\" Facebook said in a statement Thursday. \"We fight to win people's time and attention every day, and we will continue vigorously defending our company.\"\n\nTangent\n\nFacebook has sought to have new FTC chair Lina Khan recused from the agency's antitrust lawsuit based on her past history of criticizing Facebook and alleging it practices anticompetitive behavior. The Wall Street Journal reports the FTC has rebuffed their request and Khan has not recused herself from the lawsuit, noting the agency voted to refile the lawsuit in a 3-2 vote with Khan \"participating in the deliberations and supporting the new complaint.\"\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nThe FTC lawsuit could result in major consequences for Facebook should the court ultimately rule in the government's favor. The agency asks the court to declare Facebook in violation of federal law and take action to \"restore the competition that would exist\" if Facebook hadn't undertaken allegedly anticompetitive practices. This could be by breaking up Facebook, as the lawsuit calls for the \"divestiture or reconstruction of businesses\" like Instagram and WhatsApp that would make them separate entities.\n\nKey Background"}

I saw a few joke tweets suggesting people were trapped in the metaverse, and I thought to myself... what happens to an Oculus Quest when Facebook is down? Would Facebook's new camera-studded sunglasses still work? With Facebook's focus increasingly turned to a virtual and augmented reality-driven future of work and communication, amid all sorts of already-shaky problems with its platform, it's a question you might be having too.\n\nThe answer is: a weird and unfortunate mix. My Oculus headset still started up, and it still brought up a familiar virtual living room and showed me the list of apps I had installed. But Facebook's services underneath were gone. No app store. No avatars. No Facebook friends. Even the app icon graphics weren't loading.\n\nBut I could start games I had downloaded, no problem. I booted up Walkabout Mini Golf and played a hole or two; I even connected to randomly play with someone else online. I loaded Microsoft's Altspace VR and found a meditation class midsession, avatars floating around like everything was just fine.\n\nThe Oculus Quest 2, which requires a Facebook login to work, is sort of half in and half out of Facebook's cloud universe. A lot of the Quest is an Android-based piece of hardware that downloads apps and works like a game console. But what happens when Facebook's always-connected ties extend even further through the Oculus OS, when Facebook's dream of a metaverse layer of software becomes possibly the replacement to apps as we know them now? What happens when Facebook finally makes the cloud-connected, AI-driven AR glasses it is on a clear trajectory to deliver this decade?\n\nI put Facebook's newest Ray-Ban smart glasses on my face next -- the photo-taking, audio-connected sunglasses released last month -- but I didn't get very far. The Facebook-connected app on my phone, which is the only place the glasses can download its photos and videos to, wouldn't log in. I was locked out. I was also locked out of my photos.\n\nTo be clear: App- and cloud-connected devices and services (and the inherent problems) aren't unique to Facebook. Try using a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X when the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live are down. Some parts work, others don't. Try using Netflix or Disney Plus during an outage. So many services we use are cloud-based now. We're used to putting our lives somewhere else; always-on wearables are no different. Some parts will work, no doubt, and others won't. Facebook's glasses don't need to be online to take photos and video -- but they need that phone app to share them.\n\nThere are plenty of sci-fi books that have imagined a coming apocalypse of half-collapsed infrastructures: Tim Maughan's Infinite Detail is a great starting point. In that book, a rebel community in the UK has decided to take down a grid of smart tech, which causes the world to reboot and learn to live without the familiar shrouds of assisted tech.\n\nEvery time there's a power outage or cellular networks go down, we rediscover this feeling and wonder about our reliance on Google, on phones, on all our social networks. The future of AR and VR doesn't necessarily need to feel this way: Lots of existing hardware can use on-device processing to handle VR graphics or AR effects, so they'll work even when there's no online connection. That needs to remain the case."}

The company also removed accounts run by anti-vaccine groups that were using evolving tactics to attack doctors in Europe.\n\nTogether, the cat-and-mouse game described in the company's latest threat report continues to demonstrate how social media is an active battlefield where governments and motivated parties attempt to manipulate public opinion. It also shows the might of the global platform, which has recently come under renewed fire for its role in spreading societal harms.\n\nFacebook, which recently changed its corporate name to Meta, began to develop strategies to fight disinformation campaigns after Russian actors exploited its service during the 2016 election to influence the outcome. Since then, the company has engaged in hundreds of takedowns involving shadowy political organizations, marketing firms, governments and profit-motivated groups. Russia, the company said in a report last year, was still the biggest player in foreign disinformation.\n\nMeanwhile, the threat landscape has evolved significantly. Governments now outsource their disinformation efforts to a growing number of private disinformation-for-hire firms, who sometimes pay unwitting legitimate journalists and influencers to write about topics of interest. Fake profiles can now be generated by artificial intelligence. And a Facebook whistleblower and other critics have accused the company of turning a blind eye to domestic actors that seek to exploit public opinion in their own countries — particularly if those countries are strategic for Facebook's business interests.\n\nThe Facebook Papers show what its employees knew about how the website fostered polarization and how it contrasted with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's public comments. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nFacebook does not disclose the reach of the disinformation campaigns, making it difficult for outsiders to gauge their actual influence. It discloses accounts removed and the followers of those accounts, but not the views that the posts received.\n\nThe China operation was discovered, the company said, after a mysterious account claiming to be a Swiss biologist posted that the United States was pressuring and intimidating World Health Organization scientists studying the origins of the coronavirus in an attempt to blame China for the virus. The false persona was named Wilson Edwards and made the posts on Twitter and Facebook in July.\n\nAlmost immediately after the fake biologist's account, which was created only the day before, began posting its messages, Chinese state-controlled media organizations Global Times and People's Daily began covering the fake scientist's story. Facebook initially received reports about the fake account, and began to tie it and a network of hundreds of other fake personas amplifying it to actors in China, including a state-owned infrastructure company.\n\nWhile Facebook fell short of saying that the operation — which it said was quickly rooted out — was tied directly to the Chinese government, experts say such unusual timing often suggests a coordinated effort."}

Whistleblower and former Facebook employee, Frances Haugen, 37, revealed her identity after she applied for federal whistleblower protection.\n\nHaugen had presented internal documents that went to Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and The Wall Street Journal. She decided to reveal her identity and noted that Facebook realised that if they change the algorithm to be safer, people will spend less time on the site, and will click on fewer ads, making less money. \"I've seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than what I had seen before.

Speaking about algorithms, Haugen told The Journal that in human interactions, people eventually move on from a topic, but algorithms don't, which is harmful for teenagers, \"And that's part of the danger for like teenagers, right? Part of the reason why these teen girls are getting eating disorders is they one time look up weight loss and the algorithms like, 'Oh great. We'll keep showing you more and more extreme weight loss things.'\" Haugen told the Journal, \"The thing I want everyone to know is that Facebook is far, far more dangerous than anyone knows, and it is getting worse. We can't expect it to fix itself on its own.\"\n\nShe noted that Facebook was taking internal actions that did not match its public statements. \"Facebook has publicized its work to combat misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and insurrection. In reality, Facebook knew its algorithms and platforms promoted this type of harmful content, and it failed to deploy internally recommended or lasting countermeasures,\" she wrote in a cover letter to the SEC. The site allows divisive content because it promotes engagement, she told 60 minutes. \"Its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarizing, it's easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,\" Haugen said.\n\nHaugen further noted that she had empathy for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"And Mark has never set out to make a hateful platform. But he has allowed choices to be made where the side effects of those choices are that hateful, polarizing content gets more distribution and more reach,\" she said.\n\nShortly after Haugen went live, Facebook and sister companies Instagram and WhatsApp underwent almost a 7-hour long outage. It took over six hours for Facebook to resolve the issue that the company claimed arose due to a \"faulty configuration change\".

Reports of outages and disruptions began pouring in at about 11:30 EST on Monday - but Facebook's loss turned into gain for other platforms. With Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp all facing disruptions, Twitter is where all the action was on Monday. From Instagram head Adam Mosseri to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, everyone flocked to the microblogging platform as the Facebook-owned services shut out its users.\n\nSignal, the private messaging app endorsed by Edward Snowden, saw millions of people signing up as WhatsApp faced a prolonged downtime, according to Bloomberg. Millions of new users joined the app on Monday, Signal announced on Twitter. The messaging service also received an endorsement from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Responding to a tweet from Edward Snowden urging people to switch to Signal from WhatsApp, Mr Dorsey quipped: \"Signal is WhatsUp.\"\n\nDowndetector, a service that monitors reports of outages, said the Facebook service outage is the largest it has ever seen. The outage prompted an apology from Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg and a slew of memes and jokes on Twitter, with the official account of the microblogging platform itself joined the meme-fest.\n\n\"Sorry for the disruption today -- I know how much you rely on our services to stay connected with the people you care about,\" Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday as services began returning online. \"Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger are coming back online now,\" he said in his post.\n\nMeanwhile, Instagram head Adam Mosseri confirmed that it was a tough day at work as millions of users failed to access the photo and video sharing platform.\n\nWhen one Twitter user suggested \"Instagram should stay offline forever\", Mr Mosseri responded: \"Them fighting words... but it does feel like a snow day.\"\n\nSeveral Facebook employees told New York Times technology reporter Ryan Mac that they were unable to work due to the outage. \"No one can do any work. Several people I've talked to said this is the equivalent of a 'snow day' at the company,\" the reporter tweeted.\n\nFacebook blamed its October 4 outage on a \"faulty configuration change\"."}

In Brazil, the messaging service is by far the most widely used app in the country, installed on 99% of smartphones, according to tech pollster Mobile Time.\n\nWhatsApp has become essential in Brazil to communicate with friends and family, as well as for a variety of other tasks, such as ordering food. Offices, various services and even the courts had trouble making appointments, and phone lines became overwhelmed.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Haitians in their homeland and abroad fretted over the WhatsApp outage.\n\nMany of the country's more than 11 million people depend it to alert one another about gang violence in particular neighborhoods or to talk to relatives in the U.S. about money transfers and other important matters. Haitian migrants traveling to the U.S. rely on it to find each other or share key information such as safe places to sleep.\n\nNelzy Mireille, a 35-year-old unemployed woman who depends on money sent from relatives abroad, said she stopped at a repair shop in the capital of Port-au-Prince because she thought her phone was malfunctioning.\n\n\"I was waiting on confirmation on a money transfer from my cousin,\" she said. \"I was so frustrated.\"\n\n\"I was not able to hear from my love,\" complained 28-year-old Wilkens Bourgogne, referring to his partner, who was in the neighboring Dominican Republic, buying goods to bring back to Haiti. He said he was concerned about her safety because of the violence in their homeland.\n\n\"Insecurity makes everyone worry,\" he said.\n\nIn rebel-held Syria, where the telecommunication infrastructure has been disrupted by war, residents and emergency workers rely mostly on internet communication.\n\nNaser AlMuhawish, a Turkey-based Syrian doctor who monitors coronavirus cases in rebel-held territory in Syria, said WhatsApp is the main communication method used with over 500 workers in the field.\n\nThey switched to Skype, but WhatsApp works better when internet service is shaky, he said. If there had been an emergency such as shelling that he needed to warn field workers about, there could have been major problems, he said.\n\n\"Luckily this didn't happen yesterday during the outage,\" he said.\n\nBut hospitals treating COVID-19 patients in the region were thrown into panic. They lost contact with oxygen suppliers who have no fixed location and are normally reached via WhatsApp. One hospital sent staff member searching for oxygen at nearly two dozen facilities, said Dr. Fadi Hakim of the Syrian American Medical Society.\n\nIn Lima, Peru, the breakdown complicated dental technician Mary Mejia's job. Like most Peruvian medical workers, she uses WhatsApp for a multitude of tasks, including scheduling appointments and ordering crowns.\n\n\"Sometimes the doctor will be working on a patient and I need to contact a technician for job,\" she said. \"To have to step away and make a phone call? It trips us up. We've become so accustomed to this tool.\"\n\nMillions of Africans use WhatsApp for all their voice calls, so \"people felt they were cut off from the world,\" said Mark Tinka, a Ugandan who heads engineering at SEACOM, a South Africa-based internet infrastructure company.\n\nMany Africans also use WhatsApp to connect with relatives in other countries. Tinka's stepdaughter lives in Caldwell, Idaho, and lost her father on Sunday, but could not speak with her family back in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, to arrange travel for the funeral.\n\n\"It's amazing just how little folks understand the impact of three or four content companies on the utility of the Internet,\" Tinka said.\n\nFacebook said the outage was due to an internal error related to a \"configuration change\" but gave no details."}

The Berlin-based project went public with the conflict in a post published Friday morning, citing the platform's recent ban of the NYU Ad Observatory.\n\n\"There are probably more cases of bullying that we do not know about,\" the post reads. \"We hope that by coming forward, more organizations will speak up about their experiences.\"\n\n\"the company cannot be trusted\"\n\nLaunched in March 2020, AlgorithmWatch provided a browser plug-in that would allow users to collect data from their Instagram feeds, providing insight into how the platform prioritizes pictures and videos. The project published findings regularly, showing that the algorithm encouraged photos that showed bare skin and that photos showing faces are ranked higher than screenshots of text. Facebook disputed the methodology but did not otherwise take action against AlgorithmWatch for the first year of the project.\n\nIn May, researchers say Facebook asked to meet with the project leaders and accused them of violating the platform's terms of service. Another objection was that the project violated the GDPR, since it collected data from users who had not consented to participate.\n\n\"We only collected data related to content that Facebook displayed to the volunteers who installed the add-on,\" the researchers say in their defense. \"In other words, users of the plug-in where only accessing their own feed, and sharing it with us for research purposes.\"\n\nStill, the researchers ultimately chose to shut down the project, believing they would face legal action from the company if it continued.\n\nReached for comment, a Facebook representative confirmed the meeting, but denied threatening to sue the project, saying the company was open to find privacy-preserving ways to continue the research.\n\n\"We had concerns with their practices, which is why we contacted them multiple times so they could come into compliance with our terms and continue their research, as we routinely do with other research groups when we identify similar concerns,\" the representative said. \"We intend to keep working with independent researchers, but in ways that don't put people's data or privacy at risk.\"\n\nThe social nature of the Facebook platforms makes it difficult to isolate any single user: even when a user opts in, their feed is necessarily made out of other people's content, who likely have not consented to participate in the research. Facebook has been particularly sensitive about research projects since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw academic research data ultimately used for commercial and political manipulation.\n\nStill, the broader pattern is a troubling one. The algorithms that manage news feeds on Facebook and Instagram are immensely powerful but poorly understood, and Facebook's policies make it difficult to study them objectively. The NYU Ad Observatory, which tracked political advertising on the platform, saw its researchers banned earlier this month amid accusations of data scraping. In November, the company made similar legal threats against a browser called Friendly, which let users reorder their feeds chronologically. CrowdTangle, another popular tool for Facebook research, was acquired by the company in 2016."}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe tech chief, Mike Schroepfer, said in a post to his own Facebook page on Wednesday that he would leave the role sometime in 2022. He will then be replaced by Andrew Bosworth, currently the leader of Facebook's augmented and virtual reality division, further signalling Facebook's push into that business. Schroepfer has been CTO since 2013. The news was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nBosworth is another early Facebook employee and member of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's inner circle who has steadily moved up through the ranks. He joined in 2006, two years before Schroepfer, and was one of the company's earlier executives with the title of vice president. Over the years, Bosworth, known as Boz, helped build central parts of the platform, including its News Feed, Messages, and Groups, before moving on to augmented and virtual reality projects.\n\n\"This is a difficult decision because of how much I love Facebook and how excited I am about the future we are building together,\" Schroepfer wrote in his post. But he is not leaving the company entirely. He said he is to become a \"senior fellow\" within Facebook next year, a first-of-its-kind role at the company, although he did not say what exactly the role will entail.\n\nZuckerberg called Schroepfer \"a close friend\" in a statement on Facebook's press site and said he had \"played a critical role in almost everything we've done.\" He added that the senior fellow position will see Schroepfer helping with recruitment and \"continuing to foster our AI investments.\"\n\nSchroepfer is among the first of Facebook's true old-guard to move away from the company, having been there for 13 years. But other executive departures have come in recent months. David Fischer, Facebook's chief revenue officer, announced his exit in spring. Then VR leader Hugo Barra left, as did advertising head Carolyn Everson, and app head Fidji Simo.\n\nNot everyone is cheering the change, however. Samidh Chakrabarti, who was previously a director of product management at Facebook, suggested on Twitter that a Facebook without Schroepfer is \"worrisome.\"\n\n\"After I left FB earlier this month, many existing employees asked me who could now best be their ally on matters of societal import,\" Chakrabarti wrote. \"Who was on my short list every single time? Schrep. So this is indeed significant.\"\n\nIn the post announcing his job change, Schroepfer said that Bosworth was responsible for the creation of Facebook's entire AR and VR organization thus far, now called Facebook Realty Labs, and led research efforts and hardware rollouts like Oculus and Portal.\n\n\"These contributions are foundational components of our broader efforts to help build the metaverse,\" Schroepfer said. Zuckerberg echoed that point, saying in his note that Bosworth's work is \"foundational to our broader efforts helping to build the metaverse, and I'm excited about the future of this work under Boz's leadership.\"\n\nZuckerberg has been a fierce advocate for Facebook's push into AR and VR, saying on an earnings call earlier this year that he wants it to be \"a metaverse company.\" The term \"metaverse\" refers to a manifestation of the social, physical world in digital space, like in the games \"Animal Crossing\" or \"Second Life\" — or, as Zuckerberg put it, \"an embodied internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at.\""}

Of the 10,000 teens surveyed, 35% of teens named Snapchat as their favorite social media app, followed by TikTok at 30% and Instagram at 22%. However, Instagram is still the social media app most used by teens, with 81% of respondents saying they use the app at all. Snapchat clocked in slightly lower, with 77% saying they use it.\n\nTelegram has about 500 million monthly active users, meaning the number of signups on Monday was equal to about 10% of the app's existing user base, The Verge reported. The last time Telegram had a similar surge was in January, when Facebook reported problems with WhatsApp, according to the publication.\n\n\"The daily growth rate of Telegram exceeded the norm by an order of magnitude, and we welcomed over 70 million refugees from other platforms in one day,\" Durov wrote in a message on Telegram on Monday. He said that the app's newest users from the US might have experienced some delays on the platform due to the sudden influx of downloaders.\n\nDurov added, \"We won't fail you when others will,\" an apparent nod to Facebook's technical troubles that day.\n\nFacebook's suite of apps and services, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook itself, went offline for hours on Monday.

Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, the former Facebook employee, who has leaked tens of thousands of internal documents detailing the company's struggles with user safety and misinformation, also criticised Zuckerberg's \"unconscionable\" decision to invest in its metaverse concept instead of focusing on fixing its current problems.\n\nAsked if Zuckerberg should step down, Haugen said: \"I think Facebook will be stronger with someone who is willing to focus on safety, so yes.\"\n\nHowever, Haugen acknowledged that Zuckerberg's control of Meta was an issue for any independent shareholders who might wish for a change at the top. Zuckerberg controls decision-making at the company through his majority ownership of the voting shares in Meta, which makes his position unassailable.\n\n\"Mark holds 54% of the voting shares in Facebook. He is the chairman and the CEO and I think that at a minimum the shareholders have the right to actually choose their CEO. And so I think it is unlikely the company will change if he remains the CEO,\" said Haugen.\n\n\"And I hope that he can see that there is so much good he could do in the world, and maybe it's a chance for someone else to maybe take the reins.\"\n\nHaugen also criticised the strategic shift behind the company's surprise rebranding last week, with Zuckerberg committing the business to a major investment in the metaverse, a space where digital representations of people – avatars – interact at work and play, meeting in their office, going to concerts and even trying on clothes.\n\nHaugen said the documents she had released to Congress, regulators and the press made clear that the company needed to spend more on basic safety systems and not an expansion into virtual reality.\n\nThe documents released by Haugen have revealed that Meta was aware its Instagram photo-sharing app has been accused of exacerbating mental health problems for teenage girls, that its own workers were dismayed by a failure to stem misinformation spreading in the run-up to the 6 January riot in Washington, and that Facebook was helping to fan ethnic violence in Ethiopia.\n\n\"I think there is a meta problem at Facebook which is that over and over again Facebook chooses expansion in new areas over sticking the landing on what they have already done and I find it unconscionable that, as you read through the documents, it states very clearly there needs to be more resources on very basic safety systems,\" she said."}

Many have been quick to say that the incident had to do with BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, citing sources from inside Facebook, traffic analysis, and the gut instinct that \"it's always DNS or BGP.\" Facebook is back up and has since released an explanation detailing how BGP was just a part of its woes (and saying that it more or less worked as intended), but this all raises the question:\n\nWhat is BGP?\n\nAt a very basic level, BGP is one of the systems that the internet uses to get your traffic to where it needs to go as quickly as possible. Because there are tons of different internet service providers, backbone routers, and servers responsible for your data making it to, say, Facebook, there's a ton of different routes your packets could end up taking. BGP's job is to show them the way and make sure it's the best route.\n\nI've heard BGP described as a system of post offices, an air traffic controller, and more, but I think my favorite explanation was one that likened it to a map. Imagine BGP as a bunch of people making and updating maps that show you how to get to YouTube or Facebook.\n\nBGP is like a map telling your computer whose bridges it has to cross to get to Facebook\n\nWhen it comes to BGP, the internet is broken up into big networks, known as autonomous systems. You can sort of imagine them as island nations — they're networks that are controlled by a single entity, which could be an ISP, like Comcast, a company, like Facebook, or some other big organization like a government or major university. It would be extremely difficult to build bridges connecting every island to all the others, so BGP is what's responsible for telling you which islands (or autonomous systems) you have to go through to get to your destination.\n\nSince the internet is always changing, the maps need to be updated — you don't want your ISP to lead you down an old road that no longer goes to Google. Because it'd be a massive undertaking to map the entire internet all the time, autonomous systems share their maps. They'll occasionally talk to their island neighbors to see and copy any updates they've made to their maps.\n\nTurn left into the river\n\nUsing maps as a framework, it's easy to imagine how things can go wrong. Back when consumers first got access to GPS, there were always jokes about it having you drive off a cliff or into the middle of the desert. The same thing can happen with BGP — if someone makes a mistake, it can end up leading traffic somewhere it's not supposed to go, which will cause problems. If it isn't caught, that mistake will end up on everyone's map. There are other ways this can go wrong, but we'll get to those in a bit.\n\nYeah, yeah, maps. Give me an example.\n\nOf course! This is massively simplified, but imagine you want to connect to an imaginary tech news website called Convergence. Convergence uses the ISP NetSend, and you use DecadeConnect. In this example, DecadeConnect and NetSend can't talk directly to each other, but your ISP can talk to Border Communications, which can talk to Form, which can talk to NetSend. If that's the only route, then BGP would make sure that you and Convergence could communicate through it. But if alternatively, both DecadeConnect and NetSend were connected to ThirdLevel, BGP would likely choose to route your traffic through it, as it's a shorter hop.\n\nOkay, so BGP is like maps that detail all the fastest ways from you to a website?\n\nRight! Unfortunately, it can get even more complicated because the shortest doesn't always equal best. There are plenty of reasons why a routing algorithm would choose one path over another — cost can be a factor as well, with some networks charging others if they want to include them in their routes.\n\nMapping unchanging roads is hard; imagine mapping the internet\n\nAlso, maps are super tricky! I discovered this just recently trying to plan a trip where roads existed on one map and not another or were different between maps. One road even had three different names across three maps. If it's that hard to pin down for a \"town\" that has all of five roads, imagine what it's like trying to connect the entire internet together. Real roads don't change that often, but websites can move from one country to another or change, add, or subtract service providers, and the internet just has to deal with it.\n\nI remember something like this from my algorithms and data structures class — trying to build algos to find the shortest route.\n\nI'll take your word on that. I dropped out as soon as I heard about graphs."}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nOnline fraud has skyrocketed over the past year, as scammers capitalized on the widespread lockdowns that have kept people indoors all over the world.\n\nTech giants have come under pressure to take action against nefarious actors with past reports accusing Facebook of having a \"lax approach\" to the issue, while criminals continue to set up fake Google ads in a matter of hours.\n\nMore than a third (34%) of people that reported a scam ad to Google said it was not taken down while just over a quarter (26%) said the same had happened with Facebook, according to a study published by British consumer group Which?.\n\nWhich gave examples of scammers posting fake ads for discounts at established shoe retailers like Clarks or Russell and Bromley, using their logos and branding. These ads lead to look-a-like websites that steal consumers' financial details. One victim said she paid £85 for a pair of boots, but instead received a pair of cheap sunglasses.\n\nScammers post convincing fake ads for brands, such as shoe retailer Clarks. Which?\n\nThe study, of 2,000 adults in the UK, found that while Google was worse at reacting to reported scams, victims were more likely to encounter a fraudulent ad on Facebook in the first place.\n\nAround 27% said they had come up against a scam ad on Facebook compared to 19% on Google.\n\nAdam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, said the findings showed both Facebook and Google had left their users \"worryingly exposed to scams,\" and suggested the UK government bring in legislation to root out the problem.\n\n\"Online platforms must be given a legal responsibility to identify, remove and prevent fake and fraudulent content on their sites,\" he said. \"The case for including scams in the Online Safety Bill is overwhelming and the government needs to act now.\"\n\nAs part of the British government's proposed Online Safety Bill, tech companies that allow users to post their own material or talk to others online could be fined up to £18 million (around $25 million) or 10% of their annual revenue, whichever is higher, for failing to remove \"harmful\" content.\n\nThe Bill is expected to contain extra provisions for the biggest social media companies with \"high-risk features,\" expected to include Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson told Insider fraudulent activity was \"not allowed\" on its platform, adding that the company had taken action against a number of the scam pages reported.\n\n\"Our 35,000 strong team of safety and security experts work alongside sophisticated AI to proactively identify and remove this content, and we urge people to report any suspicious activity to us,\" they said.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company had previously removed more than 3.1 billion scam ads for violating its policies. \"We take action on potentially bad ads reported to us and these complaints are always manually reviewed,\" they said."}

The outage left them stranded.\n\nBut this crucial question would go unanswered for hours, after all Facebook's services—including Facebook.com, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram—suddenly became unavailable from around 11:40 a.m. US Eastern time. The outage was due to changes to Facebook's backbone routers, the firm said in a blog post. Those changes meant that traffic was not being handled properly by the Domain Name System (DNS), a tool that directs traffic and tracks addresses across the internet. In total, Facebook's apps and sites were down for almost six hours.\n\nFor many internet users in the United States, the outage was a minor annoyance. But for the millions of people around the world who rely on Facebook's products to access the internet, including Afghans that already feel abandoned by the international community's withdrawal in mid-August, the sudden downtime was far more serious.\n\nFor much of the world, Facebook has become \"synonymous with the internet,\" says Sarah Aoun, vice president for security at the Open Technology Fund, a US nonprofit that supports technology projects like the private browser Tor and encrypted message service Signal. That made the outage the equivalent of nothing less than \"a big infrastructure collapse,\" she says.\n\nThe outage also came at an inauspicious time for Facebook. On Sunday, just hours before the outage, the CBS television program 60 Minutes aired a highly anticipated interview with a Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, who has leaked a number of documents suggesting the firm knew that its products were bad for teen girls, among other revelations. She is due to testify before the US Senate later today. Facebook is also fighting an antitrust investigation in the US that could force it to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nFacebook's internet\n\nMore than 3.5 billion people around the world use Facebook's suite of social networks and apps, including Facebook.com, Messenger app, Instagram, and WhatsApp, among others. The country with the largest population of Facebook users is India, with an estimated 340 million users. (The United States, by contrast, has an estimated 200 million users.)\n\nThis was by design. For years, Facebook has been working to expand internet access in the developing world—which would also expand its own user base. The company has explored the use of satellites, drones, and radio-linked wireless networks. It has partnered with local telecommunication firms to improve physical internet infrastructure.\n\nIn 2013 Facebook launched Internet.org, an initiative that allowed users to access Facebook, and certain other websites, without incurring any data charges. This was part of Mark Zuckerberg's grand plan to get the world online by providing internet access to the 85% of the world (at the time) that had access to cellular data."}

This was also picked up by several users on the racist-slur-ridden messageboard.\n\nRon Watkins, the man accused by some to be behind the QAnon conspiracy cult, questioned whether the outage could have been a form of damage control after whistleblower Frances Haugen made several explosive claims about Facebook.\n\nSharing his unfounded claim on Telegram, Watkins said: \"Is Facebook down because of the FB whistleblower? Shutting down your service is the nuclear option of ensuring a specific item is not shared on your platform,\n\n\"It could also be a distraction meant to guide your eyes from the whistleblower.\"\n\nBoth QAnon John and Ron Watkins have hundreds of thousands of Telegram followers between them.\n\nThey will also be appearing at this month's For God and Country: Patriot Double Down weekend convention that will host several people who follow the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nAmong those attending include several Republican politicians who believe the 2020 Presidential Election was stolen from Donald Trump."}

The federal law, which is part of the Communications Decency Act, provides legal immunity to websites that moderate user-generated content.\n\n\"We're reviewing that, and certainly they should be held accountable,\" Bedingfield told MSNBC when asked about Section 230 and whether social media companies like Facebook should be liable and open to lawsuits for publishing false information that causes Americans harm.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Bedingfield said, also believes it is \"the responsibility of the people creating the content.\"\n\n\"It is a big and complicated ecosystem, and everybody bears responsibility to ensure that we are not providing people with bad information about a vaccine that will save their lives,\" she said.\n\nBoth Biden and then-President Donald Trump have advocated for revoking Section 230, but for different reasons.\n\nBiden has long railed against the law for its protection of social media companies from misinformation, whereas Trump has claimed that it leads to the censorship and suppression of conservative voices. Supporters of the provision, meanwhile, argue that the law protects free speech. Trump's attempts to use the executive branch to change how Section 230 is applied to tech companies was called unconstitutional by legal experts, lawmakers and officials at the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe Biden administration now confronts many of the same legal questions. But only Congress can amend the law itself, and while US lawmakers may be united in their hostility to Big Tech, Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill remain split on how Section 230 should be updated.\n\nBiden kept the pressure on Facebook on Monday, saying he not satisfied with what the platform is doing to stop the spread of misinformation, but backing off his accusation from last week that it was directly responsible for \"killing people.\" And senior officials are in touch with Facebook behind the scenes as tensions with the platform have escalated.\n\n\"Facebook isn't killing people – these 12 people are out there giving misinformation. Anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information,\" Biden said, appearing to cite data from the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). A report published by the organization in March indicated that about a dozen people were super-spreaders of anti-vaccine misinformation.\n\nThe President continued, \"My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally, that somehow I'm saying Facebook is killing people, that they would do something about the misinformation, the outrageous misinformation about the vaccine. That's what I meant.\""}

The outage lasted about six hours during the work day, and while it may have provided reprieve for some, it likely resulted in chaos for others.\n\nFor many brands and organizations, Facebook serves as the main platform for advertising, retail outreach, virtual events and customer service. Some smaller businesses even use it as an alternative to a website to distribute information and promote their brand. However, much like any other service, especially a free one, users should prepare for closures or resource failures.\n\nThe Problem of Over-Reliance\n\nJohn Guilfoil, principal, John Guilfoil Public Relations LLC, provides PR and communication consulting services to more than 400 entities in 11 states, including municipalities such as public schools, police and fire departments. He counsels they not rely on a single platform or service, though he admits social media is important.\n\n\"Police and fire departments are like small-to-medium corporations,\" Guilfoil says. \"They are budget-conscious and rarely have the funds for dedicated public relations staff. As a result, employees like police officers and firefighters end up assuming multiple roles in an agency and their time is stretched thin. This allows for the possibility of over-reliance on a single, familiar platform like Facebook. This is dangerous.\"\n\nGuilfoil says many small-business owners, as well as town fire chiefs, feel they don't need a website. And they don't believe in updating sites. They use Facebook instead.\n\n\"Yesterday, I went to some of their websites, and instead of a functioning news blog with lists of headlines and news stories, there was a small blank box where their Facebook page feed widget had been,\" he says. \"When Facebook went down, their ability to communicate went down with it and their news archive disappeared too.\"\n\nUtilizing Holistic Communication\n\nIt can be daunting or even intimidating for a small business or municipality to consider creating a website. However, Guilfoil advocates free, simple tools that help keep information updated in multiple places on the web. He points to sites like WordPress to launch a basic, responsive and ADA-compliant website.\n\n\"We integrate websites into social media and email marketing software, but we teach our clients 'web first,' even in 2021,\" he says. \"If we do our job correctly, we can not only save hours a week in manual posting time, but we can redundantly ensure that customers, voters, residents and stakeholders are less likely to miss content from our clients.\"\n\nDuring the Facebook outage, those Guilfoil advises were able to reach audiences because, while Facebook was down, their websites, Twitter, LinkedIn and email systems were up and running. And that's an important lesson—backup systems are important not just for Facebook, but other content platforms."}

For me, WhatsApp is as much a verb as Google, and the platform is the engine that fuels my personal and professional lives. Sometimes, despite being thousands of miles away from my family, my WhatsApp groups seem like the rooms of my childhood house: Here is my mother in one corner, fretting over my father's cavalier attitude toward the pandemic; here is an uncle nobody likes, talking about some secret conspiracy against Islam; here are my cousins sending voice notes laced with laughter, virtually re-creating a summer sleepover; here is my grandmother, reminding me to pray.\n\nFor about five hours, as the Facebook empire—including Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp—experienced a global outage, that engine sputtered to a stop for me and billions of others. For lots of people in the U.S., the outage merely stopped them from posting food photos on Instagram and instigating mask arguments on Facebook. But it meant something else in the large swaths of the developing world. Here, WhatsApp is more than just \"social media\": It's a public utility.\n\nI first downloaded the app when I moved away for college in 2008, six years before it was acquired by Facebook, for a whopping $19 billion. At the time, it operated on a subscription model: In some countries, it cost roughly $1 to download, equivalent to the cost of a handful of international text messages. For a homesick student contemplating candy and canned beans for dinner every other night, it was a pretty good deal. Today, not only is the service entirely free, but telecom companies in many countries offer data bundles that include WhatsApp and Facebook at little or no added cost, partly made possible through a controversial Facebook initiative known as Free Basics. Texting and calling cost a lot more: Sending an SMS in 2015 was 22 times more expensive in India than in the United States; in Brazil, it was 55 times as expensive. These disparities have helped fuel WhatsApp's rise in many countries. According to one estimate, nearly 500 million Indians use the platform.\n\nEven before the outage, Facebook was facing growing scrutiny over misinformation and lawsuits accusing the company of being a monopoly. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company has internal research suggesting that Instagram is toxic for girls' mental health. WhatsApp has lots of its own problems, but it doesn't take much squinting to see the app as perhaps the closest realization of Big Tech's proclamation of technology as a force for good in the global South."}

During that three-month period, Facebook reported about $29 billion in revenue. That means that Facebook makes roughly $319.6 million per day in revenue, $13.3 million per hour, $220,000 per minute, and $3,700 per second. The outlets then used those numbers to calculate revenue loss based on how long the outage has lasted.\n\nThe estimates underscore the financial impact of a massive outage on Facebook's ad business. The company said it's working on restoring its services, but hasn't said what's causing the outage. Facebook is currently back up for some people.\n\n\"We're aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience,\" Facebook tweeted about six hours ago.\n\nAs of roughly 3:30 p.m. PT/6:30 p.m. ET, Facebook services were slowly coming back online, the social network said. \"To the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us: we're sorry,\" the company tweeted. \"We've been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now. Thank you for bearing with us.\"\n\nLost revenue wasn't the only financial problem Facebook encountered on Monday. Shares in the company dropped nearly 5% to $326.23 per share amid a broad selloff in social media stocks. (Shares of Twitter and Snap were both off more than 5%.)\n\nThe slide in Facebook shares weighed on CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth, which dropped to $121.6 billion. He's now ranks below Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and is the fifth wealthiest person in the world, according to Bloomberg."}

Providing this metric for COVID-19 misinformation, the company said, is more complex.\n\n\"When it comes to COVID, though, things are evolving even more quickly so it does make prevalence even more difficult to define and measure,\" said Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, during a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe action came about a month after the White House singled out Facebook in saying that about a dozen people were responsible for creating 65% of the vaccine misinformation on social media platforms -- all of whom remained active on the social networking giant.\n\nDespite the action against \"disinformation dozen,\" the White House continued to criticize Facebook's response to misinformation.\n\n\"In the middle of a pandemic, being honest and transparent about the work that needs to be done to protect public health is absolutely vital, but Facebook still refuses to be straightforward about how much misinformation is circulating -- and being actively promoted -- on their platform,\" a White House spokesperson told CNN Business on Wednesday.\n\nFacebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the spokesperson's remarks.\n\nPoliticians, including US President Joe Biden, and advocacy groups have criticized social networks for failing to effectively combat the spread of COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation. Facebook partners with fact-checkers, directs people to authoritative information and labels misinformation. But researchers have questioned how effective those measures are in curbing the spread of false claims online.\n\n\"There will always be examples of things we missed and, with a scale of our enforcement, there will be examples of things that we take down by mistake,\" Rosen said. \"There is no perfect here.\"\n\nFacebook said it has more than 65 criteria for false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines that would prompt it to remove posts from its platforms. The company has added to this list, including false claims that COVID-19 vaccines cause Alzheimer's and that being around vaccinated people could cause secondary side effects to others.\n\nThe social network said it removed more 3,000 accounts, pages and groups for violating its rules against COVID-19 and vaccines. It has also displayed warnings on more than 190 million pieces of COVID-related content on Facebook that fact-checkers rated, and it displays these posts lower in people's News Feeds.\n\nFacebook, which partnered with Carnegie-Mellon University and the University of Maryland on a COVID-19 survey, said that vaccine hesitancy for people in the US on Facebook has declined by 50%. Vaccine acceptance increased by 35% in France, 25% in Indonesia and 20% in Nigeria, the social network said.\n\nThe company also shared new data including what domains, links, pages and posts were the most widely viewed in the US on Facebook between April and June. Facebook counts a view when content appears on the News Feed, so the metric differs from engagement. The social network owns data analytics tool CrowdTangle, but executives have reportedly raised concerns about data that shows high engagement with right-wing sites.\n\n\"The narrative that has emerged is quite simply wrong,\" Rosen said, noting that CrowdTangle includes data about interactions from a limited set of certain pages, groups and accounts."}

Digital rights advocates say Facebook is striking a blow against invasive surveillance, but this may be too little too late from the enormous organization. It's also not clear where other companies will fall on the issue of facial recognition.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Facebook will shut down its facial recognition system this month after all the regulatory headaches:\n\n\"When the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook a record $5 billion to settle privacy complaints in 2019, the facial recognition software was among the concerns.

About a third of users have facial recognition features turned on in their Facebook settings, which is used to alert them of new photos, to root out photos stolen by fake accounts, and to help caption photos for blind users. (Facebook's automatic captioning still works, it just won't include specific user names anymore.)\n\nFight for the Future campaign director Caitlin Seeley George said in a statement that all facial recognition technology should be banned, making this a good step for Facebook. \"From misidentifying Black and Brown people (which has already led to wrongful arrests) to making it impossible to move through our lives without being constantly surveilled, we cannot trust governments, law enforcement, or private companies with this kind of invasive surveillance,\" she said."}

The president/director general of Facebook France has just contacted me personally to tell me the Ville de Bitche page is published again and to apologise for the inconvenience caused.\"\n\nFacebook told the Guardian the page was unpublished because of an incorrect analysis by its systems and has now been restored.\n\nThe town's page disappeared from Facebook on 19 March without any warning or apparent reason. In the interim, town hall staff created a new page, Mairie 57230, the town's postcode, to keep its residents up to date with local news and information.\n\nBefore the page was reinstated, Valérie Degouy, a spokesperson for Bitche, toldthe local radio station Radio Melodie: \"I appealed on 19 March but [the page] hasn't reappeared again.

Should we find it is failing to honour its commitments, we will not hesitate to take further action.\"\n\nFacebook said it would suspend or ban users who \"repeatedly\" create groups dedicated to fake reviews, and introduce new technology to flag such groups automatically and make it harder for people to find and join the groups in the first place.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said: \"We have engaged extensively with the CMA to address this issue. Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews. Our safety and security teams are continually working to help prevent these practices.\"\n\nThe scourge of fake reviews has spread across much of the internet. In October 2018, an investigation by Which? found that Facebook \"factories\" were producing the reviews, which were then almost entirely posted on Amazon. The e-commerce site would prioritise reviews from \"genuine\" buyers, who were then reimbursed for their trouble by the scammers on Facebook. The expensive \"genuine\" reviews were then backed up by tens of thousands of unverified positive reviews.\n\nAnother investigation looked at products on Amazon and found that 71% of headphones had perfect five-star ratings – but that the text of the reviews often referred to unrelated products such as soap dispensers. One set of headphones made by the brand Celebrat had 439 reviews. All were five-star, all unverified, and all arrived on the same day."}

Nearly 2.9 billion users were not only inconvenienced, but many also lost a crucial means of communication in regions where WhatsApp is the primary method for text messaging and voice calls.\n\nIt was quickly discovered that the culprit was a faulty configuration change on Facebook's backbone routers that manage traffic between their data centers. A simple misconfiguration was propagated across their entire network that affected not only their users, but also impacted their own tools and systems, hindering Facebook's ability to diagnose and solve the problem.\n\nA more detailed account of the problem was later published by Facebook explaining the causes and how a routine maintenance task resulted in a complete and total service blackout. An incorrect command was sent to check capacity that inadvertently disabled Facebook's border gateway protocol (BGP) routers, effectively severing its datacenters from the internet. Adding to the problem was a bug in an audit tool that should have caught the mistake, but didn't, allowing it to be deployed live across their entire environment.\n\nWith the BGP routers offline, Facebook wasn't broadcasting the routes to DNS servers on their network. DNS servers are crucial internet components that act as phonebooks, taking a domain name like www.facebook.com and translating it into an IP address. Facebook's network has its own DNS servers that maintain the IP addresses for all its domains that are shared globally across the Internet. When a user tried to access any of Facebook's domains during the outage, they were met with errors that there was no destination address to direct them to.\n\nMisconfigurations are a Top Reason for Outages\n\n\" Through 2023, \"99% of firewall breaches will be\n\ncaused by misconfigurations, not firewalls.\"\n\nIt's long been known that human error is a top cause of network and service outages. Complex environments amplify the likelihood that mistakes will be made and their effects will be more far-reaching. Through the next several years, Gartner says that misconfiguration errors will be responsible for 99% of all firewall security breaches.\n\nIn a case like Facebook, the BGP routers were the critical point of failure to an otherwise healthy network. A small change to their configuration managed to sever their connections to the internet for hours.\n\nSecurity Policy Misconfigurations Can Be Worse\n\nAlthough disruptive, it's unlikely that any security event will result from Facebook's recent outage. However, that's not always the case. Time and again small changes have led to unintended security vulnerabilities, exposing organizations to the threat of attacks should they be found and exploited.\n\n→READ: Defining Firewall Change Management & Process Workflows\n\nNetwork security policy misconfigurations not only can lead to wide-scale outages, but also are one of the easiest ways to accidentally pave the way for devastating security breaches. The Capital One breach in 2019 was directly attributed to a misconfigured firewall that left one of their cloud servers vulnerable, allowing the hacker to access sensitive data for over 100 million customers.\n\nIdentify, Eliminate and Protect with FireMon\n\nFireMon gives you visibility into high-risk policies and vulnerabilities lurking in your infrastructure and prevents you from creating new ones before policies are deployed.

But in countries like Brazil, it caused a destabilizing and disorienting seven hours ― not because Facebook.com was gone, but because WhatsApp, the messaging service the company also owns, suddenly went offline along with it.\n\nStill largely an afterthought in the United States, WhatsApp has grown into one of the world's most vital communications services. More than 2 billion people ― 1 in 4 people on the planet ― use it. Brazil and India alone are home to nearly one-quarter of them.\n\nWhatsApp's text messaging and internet-based video and audio chat platforms are especially popular in the Global South, where WhatsApp is a cheap way to avoid the often-exorbitant costs of SMS messaging and cellular data. Nearly half of Brazilians say WhatsApp is their most-used app, and more than 90% of the country's internet users are WhatsAppers — as is also the case in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Argentina, Malaysia and Colombia. Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook also owns, are the second and third most popular apps in Brazil, surveys have shown.\n\nThat ubiquity has essentially turned WhatsApp into a public utility: It's so crucial to global communications infrastructure that when it goes down, entire countries, segments of their economies, and even some basic daily governmental activities nearly grind to a halt.\n\n\"It was basically like the entire internet was out. That was the perception\" in Brazil, said David Nemer, a University of Virginia media studies professor.

Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That's done in our parliament. It's done by our government. And that's how things work here in Australia and people who want to work with that, in Australia, you're very welcome.\n\n\"But we don't respond to threats.\"\n\nReset Australia, an organisation that is lobbying for the regulation of big tech companies, said Google was bullying Australia.\n\n\"Today's egregious threats show Google has the body of behemoth, but the brain of brat,\" the executive director, Chris Cooper, said. \"When a private corporation tries to use its monopoly power to threaten and bully a sovereign nation, it's a surefire sign that regulation is long overdue.\"\n\nRepresentatives from Facebook repeated the company's previous threat to pull news content from user feeds. Josh Machin, Facebook's head of public policy in Australia, said if the code goes ahead, Facebook would potentially prevent not just news companies from posting links to news articles on Facebook, but all users based in Australia.\n\nMachin said news articles make up under 5% of what the average user sees in their feed, and Facebook did not get much commercial benefit from news articles posted on Facebook.\n\nWhen asked whether Facebook profited from fake news posted on the platform, Machin said no commercial benefit was gained by Facebook on its users posting fake news."}

What's notable here is that Facebook and Twitch are essentially customers of their own cloud platforms. When you consider how much complexity the cloud providers have pushed to their customers, these incidents keep happening — not because people are bad at cloud security but because it's really hard to get good at it. Let's explore that.\n\nWhy Cloud Risk Is Configuration Risk\n\nThe cloud attack surface is configuration, not the network. Configuration is essentially how you've designed and built your infrastructure. The word \"configuration\" can feel like a small detail, but in the cloud, configuration is a big deal. A mistake here can create vulnerabilities and break applications. A single misconfiguration can have a huge blast radius in terms of system downtime or a data breach — and the resulting loss of revenue and customer trust.\n\nTake a car, for example. A car has an engine, a transmission, wheels, etc. All of these components have configurations, some of which are related to safety and regulated by law. People and machines inspected the configurations of the car before it rolled off the line, which the owner may have changed over time. A safety inspector flags configuration violations because bad configuration can cause a breakdown or an accident."}

We want to live | Derecka Purnell\n\nA jury has found Derek Chauvin guilty of all charges against him for killing George Floyd, including unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. A judge remanded Chauvin in custody after the verdict and a cop quickly cuffed the dazed defendant to carry him out of the courtroom. Chauvin will remain in jail until his sentencing hearing in two months.\n\nPresidents did what presidents do after the criminal justice system seems to work for the people who it exploits, but this time with a twist. Neither Obama nor Biden considered the verdict justice, but rather accountability and \"a step in the right direction\". Obama emphasized eliminating racial bias in policing and implementing concrete reforms for change; Biden explained that the verdict was a giant step forward towards justice in America.\n\nThere are two fatal flaws with these statements. The first is that reforms cannot fix racial bias in policing because police was formed as a system of racial and economic control, and remains so. As I've written before: if Derek Chauvin were the kindest cop in Minnesota and did not have a biased bone in his body, he still would have been able to arrest George Floyd for any number of alleged illegal acts. Because of capitalism, racism and ableism, the darkest and poorest peoples in the United States are relegated to live precarious lives where they do what they can to survive, sometimes including breaking the law. Rather than eliminating the unjust conditions, cities and the federal government send in police to manage the inequality.\n\nAdditionally, even if we could remove racial bias from police, this would not solve the underlying problems of inequality and exploitation. If it did, then there wouldn't be so many poor, white people in prison. Last week, I watched a video of three cops arresting and slamming a 73-year-old white woman with dementia who was picking flowers on her way home. She'd forgotten to pay for her groceries at Walmart. Police dislocated her shoulder, and tied her hands and feet like a hog. She repeatedly cried that she wanted to go home and they chuckled at her. If removing racial bias in police is supposed to ensure that that Black people will be treated like white people under the law, then equal protection is completely insufficient for anyone's freedom and safety.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot expect cop convictions to save anyone's lives because prior cop convictions did not even save George Floyd's life. Thousands of cops have killed more than 10,000 people of all races between 2005 and 2017; only 82 cops have been charged with murder or manslaughter. According to criminologist Phil Stinson, only 19 cops were convicted and mostly on lesser charges in that time period. A judge sentenced former South Carolina cop Michael Slaeger to 20 years in prison in 2017 for shooting Walter Scott several times in the back. A judge sentenced former Chicago PD officer Jason Van Dyke in 2019 to a little over six years in prison for fatally shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times. Despite the increasing convictions, the police nationwide still kill about three people a day. Just a few years ago, Minnesota convicted a cop for a murder while on duty for the first time. Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor was sentenced to about 12 years. Why didn't all of these convictions save the thousands of people who were killed after them? Why didn't Chauvin get the message?"}

No, I am not just talking about the killing of 20-year-old Duante Wright literally a stone's throw away from where George Floyd was murdered; nor am I talking about 13-year-old Adam Toledo in Chicago. I am actually talking about 15-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant who was killed in Columbus, Ohio almost simultaneously to the time when the Chauvin verdict was being handed down.\n\nSince the start of the Chauvin trial three weeks ago, over 60 people have been killed by police in the United States. Over 1,000 people are killed by police every year. Only half of these killings are actually ruled as justifiable and yet well less than 1% of officers are ever charged or convicted. This has not stopped taxpayers from dishing out billions of dollars in misconduct settlements.\n\nSo, while people are viewing Chauvin's murder conviction as an indictment on policing as a whole, this is clearly not the case. The Chauvin verdict was just for one killing. What people actually want is accountability for the entire system. As I mentioned to NBC News, \"In court, individuals are prosecuted... Because of the over individualization of our court system, institutions are let off the hook. The court system magnifies the bad apple narrative.\"\n\nSteven Schleicher, who along with fellow prosecutor Jerry Blackwell and the rest of the team assembled by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, was masterful. But even he stated as such during closing arguments. Schleicher stated, \"He (referring to Chauvin) is on trial for what he did, not who he was.\" Schleicher was aiming to highlight that Chauvin lost his right to be called a cop. He was also admitting the realization that it is difficult to convict police officers of crimes, especially when a white cop does something to a Black person.\n\nThough the Chauvin trial had all the elements to make this a slam dunk decision, the case was a litmus test on police-community relations and race relations in America. I mean if there was not a conviction in this case, what would it say about how far we still have to go as a nation? There was a myriad of video evidence, numerous in-person witnesses who saw the crime, a slew of officers testifying against Chauvin that his actions were unreasonable, a slew of medical experts, an all-star prosecution team, and a racially-diverse jury. Sadly, it takes this kind of overwhelming evidence in order to convict police officers in America, even officers who have nearly 20 misconduct complaints.\n\nAltogether, the Chauvin trial was an exemplar. However, it remains an outlier and far from the norm of what typically happens when police use unjustifiable force and do not get convicted.\n\nPatrick Yoes, The National President of the Fraternal Order of Police stated on CNN that \"we can go one step closer to getting past this very dark day in American history.\" His statement suggests that Chauvin was acting in isolation and not with three other former officers, one of whom pulled a gun on Floyd minutes earlier and another, Chauvin's former partner, who had a series of misconduct complaints. Chauvin was not just a bad apple operating in isolation. Rather, he was part of a rotten tree in policing that allowed him to proliferate."}

Minneapolis public schools announced they would revert to distance learning starting Wednesday in anticipation of a verdict.\n\nBefore the jury was brought in Thursday, Chauvin, his COVID-19 mask removed in a rare courtroom moment, ended weeks of speculation by informing the judge he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.\n\nShortly afterward, the defense rested its case, after a total of two days of testimony, compared with two weeks for the prosecution.\n\nJudge Peter Cahill reminded the jurors they will be sequestered starting Monday and said: \"If I were you, I would plan for long and hope for short.\"\n\nChauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death after the 46-year-old Black man was arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market last May.\n\nBystander video of Floyd gasping that he couldn't breathe as bystanders yelled at Chauvin to get off him triggered worldwide protests, violence and a furious examination of racism and policing in the U.S.\n\nThe most serious charge against the now-fired white officer, second-degree murder, carries up to 40 years in prison, though state guidelines call for about 12.\n\nProsecutors say Floyd died because the officer's knee was pressed against Floyd's neck or close to it for 9 1/2 minutes as he lay on the pavement on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind him and his face jammed against the ground.\n\nLaw enforcement veterans inside and outside the Minneapolis department testified for the prosecution that Chauvin used excessive force and went against his training, while medical experts said Floyd died of asphyxia, or lack of oxygen, because his breathing was constricted by the way he was held down.\n\nChauvin attorney Eric Nelso n called a police use-of-force expert and a forensic pathologist to help make the case that Chauvin acted reasonably against a struggling suspect and that Floyd died because of an underlying heart condition and his illegal drug use. Floyd had high blood pressure and narrowed arteries, and fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in his system.\n\nThe only time Chauvin has been heard defending himself was when the jury listened to body-camera footage from the scene. After an ambulance had taken Floyd away, Chauvin told a bystander: \"We gotta control this guy 'cause he's a sizable guy... and it looks like he's probably on something.\"\n\nThe decision of whether Chauvin should testify carried risks either way."}

The choice of who does what is no accident.\n\nWhile Derek Chauvin 's attorney, Eric Nelson, works alone, the prosecution is being handled by two assistant attorneys general, Matthew Frank and Erin Eldridge, and two outside lawyers, Jerry Blackwell and Steve Schleicher. Ten more are working behind the scenes, many for free.\n\nExperts agree the roles played by prosecutors are based on the skill sets each brings, but appearances matter, too.\n\nWHY DID BLACKWELL GIVE THE OPENING STATEMENT?\n\nThe undercurrent of racial tension — a white police officer accused of killing a Black man — can't be ignored. Blackwell is a prominent Black civil rights attorney and one of the founders of the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers. Last year, he won a posthumous pardon for a Black man wrongly convicted of rape before the infamous Duluth lynchings of 1920.\n\nBut law professors following the case said it's Blackwell's unique ability to translate complicated legal jargon into information jurors can understand that made him the obvious pick to lay out the prosecution's case.\n\n\"One of the things he's known for is his ability to speak English rather than 'legalese,'\" said Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota. \"It's extremely important in this case just to try to explain what the elements of the crimes are that Mr. Chauvin is charged with.\"\n\nASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIN ELDRIDGE QUESTIONED TWO OF THE YOUNGEST WITNESSES. WHY?\n\nEldridge joined the Minnesota attorney general's office in 2018. Before that, she served as a special assistant U.S. attorney in Nebraska and the Northern District of Iowa.\n\nJonathan Simon, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted that our culture associates women with \"being more caretaking toward children, toward juveniles.\"\n\nUsing Eldridge as the questioner may help to \"ease the witnesses' experience and get their testimony as effectively as possible, but also to help the jury see this in the most sympathetic light,\" Simon said.\n\nDaly said Eldridge \"was particularly adept at showing empathy and kindness and a certain softness, which I think is really important when you're questioning children.\"\n\nWhen an 18-year-old witness, Alyssa Funari, began to cry, Eldridge told her to take her time and offered a tissue.\n\n\"Is this difficult for you to talk about?\" Eldridge asked. \"Do you need a minute?\"\n\nIS THERE A DRAWBACK TO USING SO MANY DIFFERENT PROSECUTORS?\n\nSt. Louis University School of Law professor Sue McGraugh said she sought to make a personal connection with jurors when she was a prosecutor. She said she's rarely seen a case with so many prosecutors, and that it carries some risk.\n\n\"It's unusual because, as someone who has tried a lot of cases, you do want the jury to form some sort of attachment to someone on the legal team,\" McGraugh said.\n\nSO, WHY SO MANY?\n\nIt's evidence of the stakes in the trial that Daly called \"possibly one of the most important cases ever in the United States and possibly the world.\"\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz appointed Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution just days after Floyd's death, and Ellison vowed to utilize whatever resources were necessary.\n\nFrank and Schleicher have handled the lion's share of questioning since the trial began. Frank is a 21-year veteran of the attorney general's office and has led the criminal division for 14 years. Daly called Frank \"the most experienced and skilled lawyer in the criminal division of the attorney general's office.\""}

To render a verdict, they also had to interpret Minneapolis Police policies, Floyd's cause of death, and the specific language of the law.\n\nThe jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty of all three charges – second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder, and up to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.\n\nThe actual sentences would likely be much lower, though, because Chauvin has no prior convictions. Minnesota's sentencing guidelines recommend about 12.5 years in prison for each murder charge and about four years for the manslaughter charge. The judge would ultimately decide the exact length and whether those would be served at the same time or back-to-back.\n\nThe second-degree unintentional murder charge alleged Chauvin caused Floyd's death \"without intent\" while committing or attempting to commit felony third-degree assault. In turn, third-degree assault is defined as the intentional infliction of substantial bodily harm.\n\nThe third-degree murder charge alleged Chauvin caused Floyd's death by \"perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.\"\n\nThe second-degree manslaughter charge alleged Chauvin caused Floyd's death by \"culpable negligence whereby the person creates an unreasonable risk, and consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm.\"\n\nEach of the three charges required prosecutors to prove that Chauvin's actions were not objectively reasonable and that they were a substantial cause of Floyd's death.

His heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint.\"\n\nFloyd had hypertensive heart disease, Baker said, \"meaning his heart weighed more than it should.\" This meant Floyd's heart needed more oxygen than a normal heart and was \"limited in its ability\" to provide more oxygen when there was a demand for it.\n\nIn the midst of an altercation and being held to the ground, adrenaline would pour into the body, Baker said, making the heart beat faster.\n\n\"In my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions,\" he said.\n\nChauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, has argued that Floyd died as a result of drugs and preexisting health conditions. And under cross examination, Baker said he believed those factors played a role.\n\n\"So in your opinion,\" Nelson asked, \"both the heart disease as well as the history of hypertension and the drugs that were in his system played a role in Mr. Floyd's death?\"\n\n\"In my opinion, yes,\" Baker said.\n\nBut Baker reiterated he stood by the cause of death he wrote on Floyd's death certificate and his finding Floyd's death was a homicide, which to a medical examiner means his death was caused by another person and does not necessarily indicate guilt."}

The video, which is over 10 minutes long in all, begins with Chauvin already on Floyd's neck, so it was not immediately clear how long he had been on Floyd prior to the video's start.\n\nIn June, weeks after the initial complaint, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office told CNN that Chauvin actually had his knee on Floyd for 7 minutes and 46 seconds.\n\n\"These kinds of technical matters can be handled in future amendments to the criminal complaint if other reasons make it necessary to amend the complaint between now and any trials,\" the county said in a statement, adding the error \"made no difference\" in the decision to charge the former officer.\n\nEvidence from the officers' body cameras released in later months led to the the timing of over 9 minutes."}

Stiger did not give much ground, saying the officer's knee in some of the contested images still seemed to be near Floyd's neck, though he agreed his weight might have shifted at times.\n\nIn other testimony, the lead Minnesota state investigator on the case, James Reyerson, initially agreed with Nelson that Floyd seemed to say in a police body-camera video of his arrest, \"I ate too many drugs.\"\n\nBut when a prosecutor played a longer clip of the video, Reyerson said he believed what Floyd really said was \"I ain't do no drugs.\"\n\nChauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death May 25. Floyd, 46, was arrested outside a neighborhood market after being accused of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. A panicky-sounding Floyd struggled and claimed to be claustrophobic as police tried to put him in a squad car, and they pinned him to the pavement.\n\nBystander video of Floyd crying that he couldn't breathe as onlookers yelled at Chauvin to get off him sparked protests and scattered violence around the U.S.\n\nNelson has argued that the now-fired white officer \"did exactly what he had been trained to do over his 19-year career,\" and he has suggested that Floyd's drug use and his underlying health conditions are what killed him, not Chauvin's knee, as prosecutors contend. Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's system.\n\nBreahna Giles, a state forensic scientist, testified Wednesday that pills found in the SUV Floyd was driving contained methamphetamine and fentanyl. Another witness, forensic chemist Susan Meith, testified that remnants of a pill found in the back of the police squad car also contained methamphetamine and fentanyl. Earlier testimony revealed that this pill contained DNA from Floyd's saliva.\n\nEarlier, Nelson asked Stiger about uses of force that are commonly referred to by police as \"lawful but awful.\" Stiger conceded that \"you can have a situation where by law it looks horrible to the common eye, but based on the state law, it's lawful.\"\n\nNelson has argued, too, that the officers on the scene were distracted by what they perceived as an increasingly hostile crowd of onlookers."}

He even suggested that it was safer for the subject because if they get up and fall they might hurt their face.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt. You've put the suspect in a position where it's safe for you, the officer, safe for them, the suspect, and you're using minimal effort to keep them on the ground,\" Brodd said.\n\nOn cross-examination, Brodd explained that he doesn't consider the prone control position to be a use of force because it does not cause pain. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher then showed Brodd a still image of Chauvin's knee digging into Floyd's neck and asked whether that position might cause pain. Brodd said it \"could,\" so Schleicher asked him if that means Chauvin's action was a use of force.\n\n\"Shown in this picture, that could be a use of force,\" Brodd said.\n\nBrodd's testimony came Tuesday as the defense called its first six witnesses in Chauvin's trial, including two who discussed Floyd's prior arrest and drug use in May 2019. Together, the witnesses furthered the defense's three main arguments in the case: that Floyd died due to drug and health problems, that Chauvin's use of force was ugly but appropriate, and that a hostile crowd of bystanders distracted Chauvin.\n\nThe prosecution rested its case in the morning after calling 38 witnesses over 11 days. Prosecutors sought to prove that Chauvin used excessive and unreasonable force when he kneeled on Floyd's neck and back for nine minutes and 29 seconds last May. Their case relied heavily on multiple videos of Chauvin's actions, analysis by policing experts and medical testimony as to how Floyd died.\n\nOne of the final witnesses to take the stand Monday was Floyd's brother Philonise, who cried as he described his brother as a big mama's boy who was distraught by her death in 2018.\n\n\"It was so unique how they were with each other. He would lay up onto her in the fetus position like he was still in the womb,\" he said. \"Being around him, he showed us how to treat our mom and how to respect our mom. He just – he loved her so dearly.\"\n\nChauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. The defense's case is expected to last only a few days, and closing arguments are expected for next Monday, Judge Peter Cahill said Monday.\n\nPolicing expert says prone control position isn't use of force\n\nBarry Brodd testified on Tuesday that Derek Chauvin \"was acting with objective reasonableness.\" Pool\n\nMuch of Brodd's testimony starkly contradicted the prosecution's policing experts and Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who said Chauvin's actions were \"in no way, shape or form\" within department policy, training, ethics or values.\n\nFor one, Brodd said it didn't matter that Floyd was already handcuffed because any person resisting should go to the ground in a prone control position."}

It was recorded as 8 minutes, 46 seconds in an initial criminal complaint — a figure that became symbolic to many in the weeks after Floyd's death — before a math error was corrected to make it 7:46.

But the time stamps cited in that charging document indicate it was actually 7 minutes, 46 seconds.\n\nThe Associated Press began asking about the error the day after the initial charges were filed, but prosecutors repeatedly declined to address it. The 8:46 detail was repeated in an amended complaint filed days later by the Attorney General's Office.\n\nIn the weeks that followed Floyd's death, some demonstrators staged \"die-ins\" that lasted 8 minutes, 46 seconds, some lawmakers knelt for that amount of time in the U.S. Senate, and mourners at a memorial service for Floyd stood in silence for 8:46 to reflect on the final moments of his life.\n\nIn mid-June, prosecutors acknowledged the one-minute error, but said it would have no impact on the case.\n\nDocuments filed by prosecutors in September and October changed the timing yet again. These documents contain the most detailed picture of what happened, citing time stamps from Lane, Keung and Thao's body camera videos.\n\nThe documents don't list an exact time for when Chauvin began kneeling on Floyd, but instead provide a narrative for when Floyd was first pressed to the ground. Time stamps on video from Lane's body camera — recorded in 24-hour-clock format — show that began at some point from 20:19:14 to 20:19:45, meaning from 14 to 45 seconds after 8:19 p.m.\n\nBut the documents cite a clear moment when Chauvin removed his knee, when a stretcher was ready to take Floyd away. Lane's body camera time-stamp read 20:28:45."}

The filing comes just weeks after a jury convicted Chauvin of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nChauvin's attorney said the court made several errors in handling the case, including \"abuse of discretion that deprived the Defendant of a fair trial; prosecutorial and jury misconduct; errors of law at trial; and a verdict that is contrary to law.\"\n\nWhile the request for a new trial does not include any specific examples of jury misconduct, the filing repeatedly argues that the court failed to shield jury members from the publicity surrounding the trial.\n\n\"The publicity here was so pervasive and so prejudicial before and during this trial that it amounted to a structural defect in the proceedings,\" the filing said. It also accused prosecutors of \"pervasive, prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct\" including disparaging the defense and failing to adequately prepare witnesses.\n\nAlthough the document does not mention any jurors by name, the filing comes amid a controversy surrounding one of the jury members. In a photo at a march in Washington, D.C., last August, juror Brandon Mitchell can be seen wearing a shirt that says \"Get Your Knee Off Our Necks.\"\n\nIn his juror questionnaire, Mitchell said he had not attended any protests against police brutality. Mitchell told CBS Minnesota on Monday that he had attended the march to support voter turnout in the 2020 election.\n\nThe filing also seeks an order for a hearing to \"impeach the verdict,\" on the grounds that \"the jury committed misconduct, felt threatened or intimidated, felt race-based pressure during the proceedings, and/or failed to adhere to instructions during deliberations.\" According to the rule cited in the filing, such a hearing would involve jurors being examined under oath and their testimony being recorded.\n\nUniversity of St. Thomas law professor Rachel Moran told CBS Minnesota that it's unlikely Chauvin's legal team will succeed in overturning the verdict.\n\n\"It's really hard to overturn a conviction, and courts are especially reluctant to interfere with the jury deliberation process,\" Moran said.\n\nThe original jury, which consisted of six White people, four Black people and two multiracial people, heard 13 days of testimony from medical experts and law enforcement officials. Multiple members of the Minneapolis Police Department testified, including the police chief — who told jurors that Chauvin's conduct was \"not part of our training\" and \"certainly not part of our ethics or values.\"\n\nThe jury, which was sequestered during deliberations but not during the earlier part of the trial, reached a verdict in less than a day.\n\nChauvin is now awaiting sentencing on the charges. Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison in Minnesota. Third-degree murder has a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison, and second-degree manslaughter has a maximum sentence of 10 years.\n\nWhile Chauvin may face less time because he does not have a criminal history, prosecutors have also introduced multiple \"aggravating factors\" that could add to his sentence. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 25."}

Mitchell, who is Black, said the jury room was a relief after three weeks of emotional testimony that he described as \"like a funeral\" day after day.\n\n\"It's not human nature to watch people die,\" Mitchell said in an interview with The Associated Press, describing testimony that day after day included video of Floyd's desperate cries as he was held down by Chauvin. \"You know you want to be able to help somebody... watching the same person die every day, and you see his family member in the (courtroom).\"\n\nProsecutors said Chauvin pinned Floyd, a Black man, to the pavement outside Cup Foods in Minneapolis for 9 minutes, 29 seconds on May 25.

Three other officers, since fired, face trial in August.\n\nProsecutors played a wide range of videos for the jury, including teenager Darnella Frazier's bystander video that was seen worldwide in the hours after Floyd's death. That video and the officers' body camera video recorded bystanders shouting at Chauvin and the other officers to get off Floyd, warning that they were cutting off his breathing and asking them to check for a pulse.\n\n\"It's cold in the room. It just feels dark,\" Mitchell said of the weeks of testimony. \"It felt like a funeral in there... The decision was the easy part.\""}

It attributed Floyd's death to \"medical distress\" and made no mention that the Black man had been pinned to the ground at the neck by Chauvin, or that he'd cried out that he couldn't breathe.\n\nMany were posting the release to highlight the distance between the initial police narrative and the evidence that led to the conviction Tuesday, including excruciating video shot by a teenage bystander of Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck, even after Floyd had stopped moving.\n\nAnd while Chauvin's conviction is a high-profile case of video rebutting initial police statements, criminal justice experts and police accountability advocates say the problem of inaccurate initial reports — especially in fatal police encounters — is widespread.\n\n\"If it wasn't for this 17-year-old who took the video, Derek Chauvin would in all likelihood still be on the police force training officers,\" said Andre Johnson, a University of Memphis professor of communication studies. \"Sadly, this has been going on for a while, and it's just now coming to light for a lot of Americans because of video evidence.\"\n\nFor their part, police officials say they give the most accurate information they can during fast-moving and complicated investigations. But the frequency with which misleading information is published cannot be ignored, critics say.\n\nIn 2014, the New York Police Department's narrative of Eric Garner's death was that he'd gone into cardiac arrest. It made no mention of an officer's extended chokehold on Garner, shown in a bystander video that captured repeated pleas that he couldn't breathe. A grand jury declined to indict the since-fired officer Daniel Pantaleo, who said he was using a legal maneuver called a seat belt.\n\nA year later, then-policeman Michael Slager said he shot Walter Scott because he'd grabbed for the officer's stun gun. But bystander video of the North Charleston, South Carolina, shooting showed Slager chase Scott after he fled a traffic stop and fatally shoot him in the back. Slager was charged with murder in state court, but released after a hung jury. He later pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations.\n\nAs the chorus of complaints about misinformation on such interactions grows, so do calls for body cameras for police. Roughly 80% of departments with 500 officers or more are now using cameras, but video storage can be costly.\n\nOfficial police video is also increasingly showing discrepancies in initial police narratives, though generally the images are withheld for days or sometimes months during internal investigations.\n\nChicago police were ordered by a court to release dashcam video of the 2014 killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald more than 13 months after the shooting. It was initially ruled a justified shooting based on an officer narrative that McDonald had approached police while refusing to drop a knife. The video showed then-officer Jason Van Dyke shooting the teen 16 times as he walked away. Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder.\n\nJohnson said it shouldn't take video evidence of Black Americans being mistreated or killed for people to support policing changes. He noted that when there is video evidence, it's often scrutinized and still rejected by some as fake or deceptive."}

The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nJury selection begins in Chavin's state case on March 8 — he faces second-degree murder and manslaughter charges — with opening statements scheduled for March 29.\n\nFloyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck while he was handcuffed and saying he couldn't breathe. Floyd's death sparked protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a nationwide reckoning on race.\n\nThree other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter and are scheduled to face trial in August. Like Chauvin, all three were fired soon after Floyd's death.\n\nThe increased federal grand jury activity in connection with Floyd's death comes as the Justice Department, under President Joe Biden, is expected to focus more on civil rights issues, criminal justice overhauls and policing policies in the wake of nationwide protests over the death of Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.\n\nAt his confirmation hearing this week, Judge Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for attorney general, emphasized his commitment to combating racial discrimination in policing, telling the Senate Judiciary Committee that America doesn't \"yet have equal justice.\"\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr had previously said that, as is standard department policy, the Justice Department was first going to allow a state prosecution to move forward before the federal investigation would be resolved. It's unclear what specifically prompted the increased grand jury activity in the last few weeks, though most federal grand juries are discharged after about 18 months.\n\nChauvin was prepared to plead guilty to a state charge of third-degree murder in Floyd's death before Barr personally blocked the plea deal last year, two law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the talks told the AP. Barr rejected the deal in part because he felt it was too soon as the investigation into Floyd's death was still in its relative infancy, the officials said."}

But it will be two months before the former Minneapolis police officer learns his sentence for George Floyd's death.\n\nChauvin, 45, was convicted Tuesday of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes as the Black man said he couldn't breathe.\n\nEven though he was found guilty of three counts, under Minnesota statutes he'll only be sentenced on the most serious one — second-degree murder. While that count carries a maximum sentence of 40 years, experts say he won't get that much. They say that for all practical purposes, the maximum he would face is 30 years, and he could get less.\n\nHere's a breakdown on Minnesota's sentencing nuances:\n\nWHY WON'T WE SEE MULTIPLE SENTENCES?\n\nBecause all the charges stem from one act, carried out against one person. Multiple sentences are typically handed down in cases when there are convictions for multiple victims, or multiple crimes against one victim.\n\nFor example, if a defendant is convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a woman — two crimes against one victim — a judge would issue a sentence on each count, and could rule that they be served at the same time or consecutively, said former Hennepin County chief public defender Mary Moriarty.\n\nThat's not the case here, Moriarty said. \"This case involved three different theories of the same behavior toward the same person.\"\n\nIS THERE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS?\n\nIn another high-profile murder case involving a Minneapolis officer, Mohamed Noor was convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2017 shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. Noor was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison on the third-degree murder conviction, but no penalty was issued for manslaughter.\n\nIf Noor's murder charge is tossed out on appeal, which is pending, he would then be sentenced on that lesser count. Likewise, if Chauvin's second-degree murder count is ultimately dismissed, he would be brought back to court for resentencing on the top remaining charge.\n\nWHY IS IT UNLIKELY CHAUVIN WILL GET THE 40-YEAR MAX?\n\nMinnesota has sentencing guidelines that were created to establish rational, consistent sentences and ensure sentences are neutral without considering factors such as race or gender. The guidelines say that even though they are advisory, presumptive sentences \"are deemed appropriate\" and judges should only depart from them when \"substantial and compelling circumstances can be identified and articulated.\"\n\nFor second-degree unintentional murder, guidelines say the presumptive sentence for someone with no criminal record like Chauvin would be 12 1/2 years. Judges can sentence someone to as little as 10 years and eight months or as much as 15 years and still be within the advisory guideline range.\n\nBut in this case, prosecutors are seeking a sentence that goes above the guideline range, called an \"upward departure.\" They cited several aggravating factors, including that Floyd was particularly vulnerable, that Chauvin was a uniformed officer acting in a position of authority, and that his crime was witnessed by multiple children — including a 9-year-old girl who testified that watching the restraint made her \"sad and kind of mad.\"\n\nAfter the verdicts, Attorney General Keith Ellison said: \"We believe there are aggravating factors and the sentence should exceed the sentencing guidelines.\"\n\nSO WHAT'S REALISTIC?"}

Groups of workers fanned out in the darkness and started removing barricades and other structures that, for nearly a year, had cut off the flow of traffic on two major thoroughfares: Chicago Avenue and East Thirty-eighth Street. The reaction to what looked like a cross between a covert op and a public-works project was immediate; residents of the mixed-income neighborhood began texting and posting a flurry of messages on social media as they streamed out of their homes. Across town, one of those texts reached Jay Webb, a gardener and a caretaker of the Square. He got dressed and hustled out the door. Another observer said in a video on Instagram, \"Greetings from G.F.S. They're coming! They're coming!\"\n\nSince last summer, the barricades had told visitors that, as a hand-painted sign announced, \"you are now entering the Free State of George Floyd.\" At the center of the area was the intersection outside the Cup Foods grocery store, where Floyd died, on May 25, 2020, after the police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds during an arrest, while three other officers stood by. In the chaotic fury that swept the nation in the days afterward, hundreds of businesses in Minneapolis were vandalized, and a hundred and fifty buildings, including the Third Precinct, where Chauvin worked, were set on fire. There were protests in the intersection, but mourners, activists, tourists, and community members soon turned the area into a sort of shrine, leaving messages, flowers, and candles. A painted silhouette marked the spot where Floyd had died.\n\nOne night, a week after his death, law-enforcement officials drove through the makeshift memorial. In response, residents dragged cinder blocks, furniture, and even an old refrigerator into the streets to block traffic. Mayor Jacob Frey, who at one point referred to the area as \"sacred ground,\" had concrete construction barriers placed at the intersection, ostensibly to protect pedestrians. But the barriers also deepened the sense that George Floyd Square was now a place unto itself. An ad-hoc committee of activists and residents erected and staffed guard shacks at entrances. An abandoned Speedway gas station was repurposed as the People's Way, and an improvised fire pit, set up between empty pumps, became a gathering place. Webb collected the detritus of the protests—bricks and plywood that had covered windows—and used it to build a roundabout structure in the middle of the intersection. It included a platform where visitors could leave flowers and messages, and a nine-foot-tall steel sculpture of a fist that the artist Jordan Powell Karis had designed, as a replica of an earlier wooden sculpture, and that residents helped assemble. The Square was becoming more than a shrine to Floyd's life; it was a monument to others who had died in encounters with police, and a headquarters for an emergent movement.\n\nThen, on April 20th of this year, Chauvin was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter. On June 25th, Judge Peter Cahill sentenced him to twenty-two and a half years in prison. The three other officers will be tried next year, and federal indictments have been handed down against all four of them. Many Americans saw the verdict as a just resolution to a public tragedy. The Square's reopening seemed part of a general spirit of relief and a desire to move on from the horror of Floyd's death and the tensions that had turned Minneapolis into a microcosm of the national debate about race and policing.\n\nBut another view, held with at least equal resolve, considered the trial only one concern in a constellation of many that needed to be addressed before there could be anything resembling closure. During the trial, Webb, who stands six feet nine inches tall and looks to be about fifty (though he said that he considers himself just a day old—the day he's living), told me he was concerned that \"when the flowers die, and the helium is gone from the balloons, people will forget the entire case.\" The monument that he built was intended to prevent that from happening. \"This cannot just be another corner,\" he said. His implication was that, although the world saw Floyd's death as a singular incident of spectacular violence, people in parts of Minneapolis, particularly in the Square, were more likely to connect his death to a long genealogy of events that both preceded and followed it, and which few outside of that community knew much about."}

He also cited the presence of children when he committed the crime and the fact Chauvin was part of a group with at least three other people.\n\nCahill said Chauvin and two other officers held Floyd handcuffed, in a prone position on the street for an \"inordinate amount of time\" and that Chauvin knew the restraint was dangerous.\n\n\"The prolonged use of this technique was particularly egregious in that George Floyd made it clear he was unable to breathe and expressed the view that he was dying as a result of the officers' restraint,\" Cahill wrote.\n\nEven with the aggravating factors, legal experts have said, Chauvin, 45, is unlikely to get more than 30 years when he is sentenced June 25.\n\nChauvin, who is white, was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes as the Black man said he couldn't breathe and went motionless.\n\nEven though he was found guilty of three counts, under Minnesota statutes he'll only be sentenced on the most serious one — second-degree murder. Under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, he would have faced a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years on that count, and Cahill could have sentenced him to as little as 10 years and eight months or as much as 15 years and still stayed within the guideline range.\n\nBut prosecutors asked for what is known as an upward departure — arguing that Floyd was particularly vulnerable with his hands cuffed behind his back as he was face-down on the ground. They noted that Chauvin held his position even after Floyd became unresponsive and officers knew he had no pulse.\n\nWith Tuesday's ruling, Cahill has given himself permission to sentence Chauvin above the guideline range, though he doesn't have to, said Mark Osler, professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. He said attorneys for both sides will argue whether an upward departure is appropriate and how long the sentence should be.\n\nA pre-sentence investigation report will also be conducted. These are usually nonpublic and include highly personal information such as family history and mental health issues, as well as details of the offense and the harm it caused others and the community.\n\nIn arguing for the upward departure, prosecutors said Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty during the lengthy restraint, saying Chauvin inflicted gratuitous pain and caused psychological distress to Floyd and to bystanders. They also said Chauvin abused his position of authority as a police officer, committed his crime as part of a group of three or more people, and that he pinned Floyd down in the presence of children — including a 9-year-old girl who testified at trial that watching the restraint made her \"sad and kind of mad.\"\n\nCahill agreed with all but one of the prosecutors' arguments. He said prosecutors did not prove that Floyd was particularly vulnerable, noting that even though he was handcuffed, he was able to struggle with officers who were trying to put him in a squad car.\n\nBut Cahill said one of the other officers twice checked Floyd's pulse and told Chauvin he detected none, while another officer suggested rolling Floyd to his side and said he was passing out. Cahill said these officers let Chauvin know that asphyxia was actually happening — yet Chauvin held his position.\n\nCahill said when it became clear to bystanders that Floyd was in distress and stopped breathing, Chauvin continued to abuse his position of authority by not rendering aid.\n\nIn finding that Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty, Cahill wrote: \"The slow death of George Floyd occurring over approximately six minutes of his positional asphyxia was particularly cruel in that Mr. Floyd was begging for his life and obviously terrified by the knowledge that he was likely to die but during which the Defendant objectively remained indifferent to Mr. Floyd's pleas.\"\n\nDefense attorney Eric Nelson disagreed with the state, saying that prosecutors did not prove that there were aggravating factors. He said Chauvin had legal authority to assist in Floyd's arrest and was authorized under law to use reasonable force. He also said Floyd was not particularly vulnerable, saying he was a large man who was struggling with officers.\n\nNelson also argued Floyd was not treated with particular cruelty, saying that there is no evidence that the assault perpetrated by Chauvin involved gratuitous pain that's not usually associated with second-degree murder.\n\nNo matter what sentence Chauvin gets, in Minnesota it's presumed that a defendant with good behavior will serve two-thirds of the penalty in prison and the rest on supervised release, commonly known as parole.\n\nChauvin has also been indicted on federal charges alleging he violated Floyd's civil rights, as well as the civil rights of a 14-year-old he restrained in a 2017 arrest. If convicted on those charges, which were unsealed Friday, a federal sentence would be served at the same time as Chauvin's state sentence. The three other former officers involved in Floyd's death were also charged with federal civil rights violations; they await trial in state court on aiding and abetting counts."}

Maxine Waters on Saturday night called for protesters to \"stay on the street\" and \"get more confrontational\" if former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is acquitted in the killing of George Floyd.\n\nThe comments by Waters, a California Democrat and icon among progressives, were immediately seized on by Republicans who claimed that Waters was inciting violence. The congresswoman denied in a subsequent interview that she was encouraging violence, but the remarks come at a time of immense national tension amid several high-profile killings of Black people at the hands of police officers and as American cities brace for a fresh wave of protests as the Chauvin trial nears a close.\n\nWaters said she was in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, on Saturday night to show her support for protesters amid ongoing protests over the police killing of Daunte Wright and to also support his family.\n\n\"We've got to stay in the street and demand justice,\" Waters said to reporters, according to video posted on social media.\n\n\"We're looking for a guilty verdict and we're looking to see if all of the talk that took place and has been taking place after they saw what happened to George Floyd. If nothing does not happen, then we know that we got to not only stay in the street, but we have got to fight for justice,\" she added.\n\nAsked what protesters should do if there is no guilty verdict, Waters said protests should continue.\n\n\"We got to stay on the street. And we've got to get more active, we've got to get more confrontational. We've got to make sure that they know that we mean business,\" she said.\n\nAsked about the curfew put in place, Waters said, \"I don't think anything about curfew. Curfew means I want you all to stop talking. I want you to stop meeting. I want you to stop gathering. I don't agree with that.\"\n\nThe congresswoman's comments come at a particularly fraught time in the nation's history. Closing arguments are underway in Chauvin's trial, and protests continue over the killing of Wright. Authorities have ramped up security around Minneapolis, with crews installing razor wire around some police buildings and National Guard troops have been deployed in parts of the city's downtown.\n\nIn an interview with theGrio that was published on Monday morning, Waters said she was \"nonviolent\" and said her remark about being \"confrontational\" was in regard to changing the justice system in the US.\n\n\"I talk about confronting the justice system, confronting the policing that's going on, I'm talking about speaking up,\" she said. I'm talking about legislation. I'm talking about elected officials doing what needs to be done to control their budgets and to pass legislation.\"\n\nWaters told CNN on Monday evening that her reference to confrontation was meant in the context of the civil rights movement's nonviolent history, saying that \"the whole civil rights movement is confrontation.\" When pressed on the judge presiding over Chauvin's trial having said that her remarks could be grounds for an appeal, Waters replied, \"Oh no, no they didn't.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Judge Peter Cahill referenced Waters' weekend comments, telling the defense that she \"may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.\"\n\nJudge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over Chauvin's trial, referenced Waters' comments on Monday, telling the defense that she \"may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.\"\n\n\"I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function,\" Cahill later added. \"I think if they want to give their opinions, they should do so in a respectful and in a manner that is consistent with their oath to the Constitution, to respect a coequal branch of government.\"\n\nHe added, \"Their failure to do so, I think, is abhorrent, but I don't think it's prejudiced us with additional material that would prejudice this jury.\"\n\nSwift criticism from GOP\n\nWaters' comments over the weekend drew swift criticism from several Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz."}

Some have sought counseling and therapy.\n\n\"It is definitely in my spirit and it will always be there,\" Sherri Belton Hardeman said of the video.\n\n\"Watching George Floyd call for his mom just broke my heart. Me being a mom, a Black mom, a Black grandmother. We call out for our mom when we're hurting, when we're in pain, and when we're in need... And unfortunately his mom could not come to his rescue. In fact, no one came to his rescue. It's heartbreaking.\"\n\n'No room for error at all'\n\nThe jurors deliberated for more than 10 hours over two days before reaching a verdict. Chauvin, who plans to appeal his conviction, was sentenced in June to 22 and half years in prison.\n\nThe panel heard about three weeks of testimony. Prosecutors urged them to \"believe your eyes\" and rely on the video of Floyd's final moments, including cell phone footage taken by a 17-year-old woman. The defense called seven witnesses – but not Chauvin, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.\n\n\"The first thing we did was, one, we took off our (face) masks and then we exchanged names,\" Nicole Deters said.\n\n\"Some of us felt a little bit eager because we had been holding all this in for three and a half weeks,\" Brandon Mitchell added.\n\nThen came the first of many votes they would take, starting with the manslaughter count. The votes were anonymous, scribbled on pieces of paper.\n\nWhen all agreed on guilty of manslaughter, some panel members began to play devil's advocate and suggested they discuss the defense arguments. Those arguments were enumerated on a whiteboard.\n\n\"I absolutely wanted to make sure that everyone was on the same page,\" Belton Hardeman said. \"I wanted to make sure that we were doing due diligence and that we actually understood what our task was. There was no room for error at all.\"\n\nThere were about four votes on the second count before agreement was reached on guilty. They watched the video and went through reams of notes and testimony to answer questions such as: How many times was Floyd's pulse checked? What did the officers say to one another?\n\nJodi Doud posed another question: \"Wait a minute. Does the intended act of harm have to be the death of George Floyd, or can it be him not providing the life support?\"\n\n\"All of a sudden light bulbs just went on for those people I think that were undecided or on the not guilty side,\" Deters said.\n\n\"This is not what he did but more or less what he didn't do,\" Doud added, referring to Chauvin. \"He did not provide life saving measures for George Floyd when he knew that the guy was in pain or needed medical attention.\"\n\nDeters was a holdout – either for not guilty or undecided – until Doud spoke of intent.\n\n\"I was just kind of, like, 'Oh my gosh, you're totally right,'\" Deters said. \"There is intent ... to not provide lifesaving measures when he knew three times there was no pulse.\"\n\n'Race wasn't even ever mentioned'\n\nIn the jury room, Belton Hardeman said, she recalled testimony about a Minneapolis police motto: \"In our custody, in our care,\" or words to that effect."}

Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. The trial was scheduled for August.\n\nThen came a surprise: prosecutors announced that a grand jury had indicted all four officers on federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights. With the announcement of federal charges, Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill moved the state trial of Kueng, Lane and Thao to March of 2022.\n\nNow, the focus in the case is on the charges brought by the federal government. Here's what we know about what the officers are charged with and how the federal trials will go.\n\nWhat are the officers charged with?\n\nChauvin, Kueng, Lane and Thao were indicted on charges of violating Section 242 of Title 18 of U.S. Code, or depriving Floyd of his rights under the color of law.\n\nThe first count in the indictment charges Chauvin, describing him holding Floyd down with his knee on his neck, resulting in his death, with violating Floyd's right to be free from unreasonable seizure, \"which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer.\"\n\nThe second count concerns Thao and Kueng, alleging they \"willfully failed to intervene\" to stop Chauvin from using unreasonable force which resulted in Floyd's death.\n\nThe third charge, which names all four officers involved, alleges they violated Floyd's right \"not to be deprived of liberty without to due process of law, which includes an arrestee's right to be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.\" It goes on to allege Floyd was in \"clear need of medical care\" and that by \"willfully\" failing to help, they acted with \"deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to Floyd.\"\n\nIn a separate indictment involving an incident from 2017, Chauvin is charged with two counts of violating the same section of law. These counts involve a 2017 incident with a then-14-year-old who the document says Chauvin held by the throat, struck in the head with a flashlight multiple times and pinned down with his knee despite lack of resistance, resulting in injury.\n\nAre federal civil rights charges like these common?\n\nCivil rights charges like these are relatively rare: Syracuse University found that between 1990 and 2019, federal prosecutors brought roughly 41 of them each year, representing a tiny fraction of federal prosecutions.\n\nMark Osler, a former federal prosecutor and professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, said it's more typical to see an officer charged with federal civil rights violations if they are acquitted in state court, as in the case of the officers who beat Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1992 and in the case of Michael Slager, the police officer who shot and killed Walter Scott in South Carolina in 2015.\n\nIn fact, the Star Tribune reported that the Justice Department planned to arrest Chauvin at the courthouse on federal charges if he were acquitted of the state ones. When he was convicted, the federal charges came out later.\n\nWhat do the feds have to prove to convict the officers?\n\nThe section the officers are charged with violating describes a person \"willfully\" violating the rights of another under the color of law, meaning acting or pretending to act within their line of duty. It can be applied to police officers, prison guards, judges and other officials."}

He has pledged to help combat racism in policing, helping African Americans who supported him in large numbers in last year's election in the wake of protests that swept the nation after Floyd's death and restarted a national conversation about race. But he also has long projected himself as an ally of police, who are struggling with criticism about long-used tactics and training methods and difficulties in recruitment.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Biden broke his administration's silence on the trial, which has set the nation on edge for weeks, saying he was praying for \"the right verdict.\"\n\nSpeaking from the Oval Office while the jury was deliberating in Minneapolis, Biden said, \"I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict. I think it's overwhelming, in my view. I wouldn't say that unless the jury was sequestered now.\"\n\nThe president had repeatedly denounced Floyd's death but had previously stopped short of weighing in on Chauvin's trial, with White House officials saying it would be improper to speak out during active judicial proceedings. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki repeatedly refused to explain Biden's comments, doing nothing to dispel the impression that he thought Chauvin should be found guilty.\n\nThe White House had been privately weighing how to handle the verdict, dispatching specially trained community facilitators from the Justice Department in anticipation of potential protests, officials said. With word that a verdict had been reached Tuesday afternoon, Biden postponed planned remarks at the White House on his infrastructure package."}

Hundreds of people poured into the streets of Minneapolis, some running through traffic with banners. Drivers blared their horns in celebration.\n\n\"Today, we are able to breathe again,\" Floyd's younger brother Philonise said at a joyous family news conference where tears streamed down his face as he likened Floyd to the 1955 Mississippi lynching victim Emmett Till, except that this time there were cameras around to show the world what happened.\n\nOn Wednesday, Philonise Floyd described his thoughts while watching Chauvin being handcuffed. He recalled to ABC's \"Good Morning America\" how it appeared \"a lot easier\" on Chauvin than when his brother was handcuffed before his death, but said it still represented \"accountability.\"\n\n\"It makes us happier knowing that his life, it mattered, and he didn't die in vain,\" he said.\n\nThe jury of six whites and six Black or multiracial people came back with its verdict after about 10 hours of deliberations over two days. The now-fired white officer was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nChauvin's face was obscured by a COVID-19 mask, and little reaction could be seen beyond his eyes darting around the courtroom. His bail was immediately revoked. Sentencing will be in two months; the most serious charge carries up to 40 years in prison.\n\nDefense attorney Eric Nelson followed Chauvin out of the courtroom without comment.\n\nChauvin was booked soon after the verdicts were read into Minnesota's only maximum-security prison, Oak Park Heights, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Minneapolis. He is being held in a single cell under administrative segregation for his safety, Department of Corrections spokeswoman Sarah Fitzgerald said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden welcomed the verdict, saying Floyd's death was \"a murder in full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world\" to see systemic racism.\n\nBut he warned: \"It's not enough. We can't stop here. We're going to deliver real change and reform. We can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that tragedies like this will ever happen again.\"\n\nThe jury's decision was hailed around the country as justice by other political and civic leaders and celebrities, including former President Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a white man, who said on Twitter that Floyd \"would still be alive if he looked like me. That must change.\"\n\nAt a park next to the Minneapolis courthouse, a hush fell over a crowd of about 300 as they listened to the verdict on their cellphones. Then a great roar went up, with many people hugging, some shedding tears.\n\nAt the intersection where Floyd was pinned down, a crowd chanted, \"One down, three to go!\" — a reference to the three other fired Minneapolis officers facing trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder in Floyd's death.\n\nJanay Henry, who lives nearby, said she felt grateful and relieved.\n\n\"I feel grounded. I can feel my feet on the concrete,\" she said, adding that she was looking forward to the \"next case with joy and optimism and strength.\"\n\nJamee Haggard, who brought her biracial 4-year-old daughter to the intersection, said: \"There's some form of justice that's coming.\"\n\nThe verdict was read in a courthouse ringed with concrete barriers and razor wire and patrolled by National Guard troops, in a city on edge against another round of unrest — not just because of the Chauvin case but because of the deadly police shooting of a young Black man, Daunte Wright, in a Minneapolis suburb April 11.\n\nThe jurors' identities were kept secret and will not be released until the judge decides it is safe to do so.\n\nIt is unusual for police officers to be prosecuted for killing someone on the job. And convictions are extraordinarily rare.\n\nOut of the thousands of deadly police shootings in the U.S. since 2005, fewer than 140 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter, according to data maintained by Phil Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University. Before Tuesday, only seven were convicted of murder.\n\nJuries often give police officers the benefit of the doubt when they claim they had to make split-second, life-or-death decisions. But that was not an argument Chauvin could easily make."}

As of April 16th, there have been 147 mass shootings in the United States. Since the start of the trial against former cop Derek Chauvin for the recorded murder of George Floyd, a mere three weeks ago, there have been more than 60 people killed by police officers. More than half of them were Black or of Latin American descent. Without researching the details, I can guarantee that a vast majority, if not all of them involved a gun.\n\nThis isn't going to be the typical liberal rant about how guns are evil and they all need to disappear. I mean, I wouldn't be mad if they did, but I have no delusions. I grew up in Florida, and I know how much some of you worship your weapons. What I've never been able to figure out, though, is why cops and their representatives so often come out on the side against gun reform? Inevitably, whenever there's a police-involved shooting, the cop in question always claims to have shot the victim because they had a gun, or at least the cop claims to have seen one. Felt one? Sensed one? I don't know, but cops seem to always be operating under the perceived threat of being shot at by someone. And the thing is, they're not entirely wrong.\n\nThe United States, as we all know, is the most heavily armed society in the world, averaging 1.2 guns per person living here. And in spite of the common myth about all the good guys with guns, studies show that areas with more guns have more homicides. It's not a complicated concept and hardly seems to warrant a study; deadly weapons attract, maybe even manifest, violent death. Who would've thought?\n\nOfficers aren't immune to this disease, of course. They also face death by gun at higher rates in jurisdictions with lax gun laws. Which then lands us in a vicious loop because in these places with higher gun ownership, where cops can rightly assume that just about anyone is at least physically capable of shooting them, they are more likely to use lethal force. So whether you had a gun at some point but tossed it, like 13-year-old Adam Toledo; or whether you were playing with a toy gun at a park, like 12-year-old Tamir Rice; or if you were legally purchasing a gun inside the store where they sell them, like John Crawford III; or if you announced that you were legally carrying your weapon to the cop who pulled you over for a broken taillight, like Philando Castile; whatever the circumstances under which you might so much as appear to have a deadly firearm, which then may or may not end up pointed at a cop, you've now become the deadly threat yourself and lethal use of force is now justified."}

He chased Mr. Rittenhouse into a parking lot and lunged at him and — according to Mr. Rittenhouse — reached for the barrel of his gun, after which Mr. Rittenhouse shot him. After that shooting, a group of protesters turned on Mr. Rittenhouse. Gaige Grosskreutz, who was shot by Mr. Rittenhouse but survived, had been armed with a handgun. He testified that he ran toward Mr. Rittenhouse and thought that he was \"an active shooter.\" While fleeing, Mr. Rittenhouse fell. Anthony Huber attacked him, hitting him with a skateboard, before Mr. Rittenhouse shot and killed him. Then Mr. Rittenhouse shot Mr. Grosskreutz after Mr. Grosskreutz pointed his gun at him and advanced. So the self-defense claim was, legally, not a stretch.\n\nMore arcane were the discussions regarding the charge of weapons possession. Adults can openly carry firearms in Wisconsin, but when it comes to minors, the law was confusing, even to the judge. Minors are not allowed to carry guns, but one subsection could be interpreted to exempt long rifles. A local attorney called it an \"extraordinarily poorly worded statute.\" But regardless of the clarity — or wisdom — of the law, once it was determined that the rifle that Mr. Rittenhouse carried to the protest had a 16-inch barrel, the judge dismissed the charge.\n\nOne could argue that if Mr. Rittenhouse had not brought a military-style semiautomatic weapon to a volatile situation, no one would be dead. But while this line of inquiry may be consistent with many people's moral intuition, and might even make good policy, it is not the law, and Wisconsin's law was not on trial.\n\nOther features of the Rittenhouse trial were not specific to Wisconsin, and were more representative of the perniciousness of the criminal legal system as a whole. An officer testified that after the shooting, Mr. Rittenhouse approached his car with his weapon strapped to his chest and his hands up in surrender, but officers ordered him to get out of the way and rushed past him to search for the shooter. Apparently, it did not enter their minds that the baby-faced white teen could be the culprit. So Mr. Rittenhouse went home, and ultimately turned himself in."}

Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\"\n\nWhile the interview aired in the U.S. on Sunday, it was not broadcast until Monday night in Britain. On Monday, the official Instagram account used by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, showed him visiting a National Health Service vaccine site in Britain and pointed out his work with a Black church organization to encourage vaccinations.\n\nAmong the bombshell revelations in the interview, Meghan said that there had been \"several conversations\" among the royal family about \"how dark\" their baby's skin would be. Oprah confirmed to \"CBS This Morning\" that Harry said those conversations did not involve Queen Elizabeth or her husband, Prince Philip.\n\nMeghan and Harry also revealed what appeared to be other rifts within the family. Meghan decried an effort to change royal protocols that automatically gave the grandchildren of the monarch a title, starting with their son, Archie. While their son is the great-grandchild of the queen, he is the grandson of the next king, Charles.\n\n\"Even with that convention I'm talking about — while I was pregnant, they said they wanted to change the convention for Archie. Well, why?\" Meghan said. She said she was never given an answer.\n\nMeghan also revealed that a story reported in the tabloids that she had once made her sister-in-law, Catherine, cry in a spat over the flower girl dresses for her wedding was actually \"the reverse\" — as in, Catherine made Meghan cry. She said Catherine later apologized and sent her flowers and a note.\n\nHarry, meanwhile, said he was \"disappointed\" by his father and that, while he loves his brother William \"to bits,\" they're on \"different paths.\"\n\nHarry described an incident last year when the queen suddenly called off an invitation for the couple to visit, and he blamed the palace staff.\n\n\"When you're head of the firm, there is people around you that give you advice,\" he said. \"And what has also made me really sad is some of that advice has been really bad.\"\n\nRoya Nikkhah, a royal correspondent for The Sunday Times, told \"CBS This Morning\" on Tuesday that the interview was \"certainly a crisis\" for the British monarchy.\n\n\"That interview, and I've watched it twice now, has thrown out a lot more questions than answers,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Nikkhah, the interview is \"proving extremely divisive\" to Britons.\n\n\"I've just seen the results of a poll that's just come out here, which shows that a lot of young people here actually support Harry and Meghan doing that interview,\" she said. \"And the older people are firmly, squarely behind the monarchy now. \""}

Lilibet weighed 7 pounds, 11 ounces at birth, and both Meghan and Lilibet are \"healthy and well,\" after returning home from the hospital, according to a statement. The name pays homage to two of the most important women in Harry's life—\"Lilibet\" was a childhood nickname used by close family members for Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, who had trouble pronouncing her own name as a child, while Lilibet's middle name, Diana, is a nod to Harry's beloved late mother, Princess Diana, who died tragically at age 36 in a 1997 car crash in Paris. Lilibet shares a middle name with Charlotte Diana, Lilibet's only female first cousin and the daughter of Prince William and his wife Kate.

It also validated her larger business strategy.\n\nOn March 7, over 17 million Americans watched Oprah Winfrey's bombshell television interview with Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, on CBS. (Video: Reuters)\n\nWhen Oprah Winfrey's interview with Prince Harry and Meghan aired on CBS on Sunday night, it wasn't just a victory for those who like sharp inside-the-palace intrigue. It was also a win for a cuttingly modern type of media business. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. ArrowRight Since the ocean of content began swelling several years ago, top-end creators have cannily surfed the wave. They have signed major deals, sometimes committing fully to one company, such as Netflix. But the shrewdest and most clout-laden among them have made big deals that nonetheless leave them room to work with other platforms.\n\nAnd few have been shrewder at this than Winfrey.\n\nIn the past several years, the former talk-show impresario has signed an overarching content deal with Apple. It was a grand announcement, made grander by her standing at a Cupertino, Calif., event declaring, \"They're in a billion pockets, y'all.\" So far, the deal has netted such programs as a limited-series coronavirus special and regular Book Club segments.\n\nBut it's far from the only significant media partnership she has made. Winfrey is producing a musical adaptation of \"The Color Purple\" for Warner Media's Warner Bros. Her production company Harpo is behind a number of popular syndicated shows such as \"Rachael Ray,\" aired by a host of station groups. And she sold the Harry and Meghan interview to CBS's entertainment division, the crown jewel of ViacomCBS, for a reported $7 million. (Harry and Meghan were not paid.)\n\nWinfrey has a past relationship with that company, too, via the news division and \"60 Minutes,\" for which she was once a correspondent.\n\nExperts who have followed Winfrey say this has been emblematic of a career in which she knows how to gravitate to the right platform for a given piece of content.\n\n\"Oprah could have gone to another network with this interview,\" said Nancy Koehn, a historian at the Harvard Business School who has done several case studies on Winfrey. \"She could have gone exclusively to a streaming service [like Apple]. But she understood that CBS on Sunday nights, with a broad audience but also a certain amount of seriousness, was going to get a lot of people watching on television with also a lot of online engagement.\"\n\nWhile her syndicated talk show is long behind her, this was a talent forged in those days, Koehn said."}

The Duke of Sussex travelled from his home in California to make the family event, and was pictured speaking to his brother, Prince William, on the way out of St George's Chapel in Windsor.\n\nHarry's wife Meghan Markle, meanwhile, had to stay behind in the US, being heavily pregnant with a baby daughter who is due in June or July. After initially announcing their pregnancy on Valentine's Day this year, the Sussexes revealed it was a little girl they were expecting during their interview with Oprah Winfrey. Now, the couple will be planning what to call their baby girl, and there has been some speculation on social media that they might opt for a name that honours both Queen Elizabeth and the late Prince Philip.\n\nThe Queen has a nickname that was only used by her parents and by her husband, Prince Philip: Lilibet. It was believed to have come about after a young Elizabeth couldn't pronounce her own name, and it stuck throughout the years. In fact, Queen Elizabeth's father, King George VI, once famously said about his two daughters: \"Lilibet is my pride. Margaret is my joy.\"\n\nBecause this was a name the Duke of Edinburgh used right up until the end, some people feel that Meghan and Harry might consider a shorter version - Lily - for their unborn child as a sweet, indirect tribute to both of Prince Harry's paternal grandparents.\n\nThe suggestion has featured numerous times on Twitter and in different Reddit threads about possible Meghan and Harry baby names. \"I'm not sure how relationships are between the family, but Lily would be a cute way to honour the Queen (Lilibet),\" wrote one royal fan recently.\n\nThe idea was also put forward two years ago, just before Meghan gave birth to baby Archie and nobody knew whether they were expecting a boy or a girl. \"I read a prediction somewhere that they could use Lily for the Queen because of her childhood nickname Lilibet and because of Meghan's wedding bouquet being Lily of the valley. I think that's really sweet,\" posted a Reddit user.\n\nWhether or not Meghan and Harry will choose to go for something family-related for their daughter remains to be seen, but as always with a royal baby, the bookies have been placing odds on a certain few female baby names in particular. The most likely options, according to betting site Paddy Power, are:\n\nDiana (4/1 odds)\n\n(4/1 odds) Allegra (11/1 odds)\n\n(11/1 odds) Maya (12/1 odds)\n\n(12/1 odds) May (12/1 odds)\n\n(12/1 odds) Isabella (12/1 odds)\n\n(12/1 odds) Molly (14/1 odds)\n\n(14/1 odds) Alice (14/1 odds)\n\n(14/1 odds) Abigail (14/1 odds)"}

The campaign is also calling on Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the new World Health Organization-backed transfer hub based in South Africa.\n\nThis certainly won't be the first time The Duke and Duchess have raised their voices about the issue of vaccine equity. As co-chairs of Global Citizen's VAX LIVE: The Concert to Reunite the World in May — which called on world leaders, corporations, and philanthropists to ensure vaccines are available to all — they penned an open letter to Big Pharma CEOs, calling on them to urgently share COVID-19 vaccines with the world's poorest countries.\n\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health, social, and economic inequality globally,\" they wrote. \"The global vaccine rollout thus far further deepens these disparities, with the poorest and most marginalized populations most adversely impacted.\"\n\nAnd to celebrate their son Archie's second birthday, they led a global fundraising effort to support Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is co-leading the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility to get vaccines to people in low-income countries who need them most. The initiative — thanks in part to donations matched by Mastercard Impact Fund, Seadream Family Foundation, and a public charity — ultimately mobilized $3.5 million.\n\n\"The virus does not respect borders, and access to the vaccine cannot be determined by geography,\" Prince Harry said on the VAX LIVE stage. \"It must be accepted as a basic right for all and that is our starting point.\"\n\nMonths later, vaccine equity remains a dire issue. Coronavirus variants are spreading across the world, people in poor nations still can't access vaccinations or treatments, and rich countries continue to hoard vaccines as they move forward with COVID-19 booster plans (despite the World Health Organization and other health experts saying such plans at this stage will only exacerbate extreme vaccine inequity). The Duke and Duchess' message is sure to be one world leaders need to hear.\n\nAdditional appearances announced Tuesday for the global broadcast event include United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley, Education Cannot Wait Director Yasmine Sherif, Namati CEO Vivek Maru, Rotary President-elect Jennifer Jones, SDG Champion and Advocate Eddie Ndopu, Ford Foundation President Darren Walker, Paris Peace Forum Steering Committee President Trisha Shetty, Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., UN Next Generation Fellow Valeria Colunga, advocate Eunice Akoth, and more.\n\nAs part of our year-long Recovery Plan for the World campaign, Global Citizen Live will showcase a day of unity spanning seven continents, bringing together more than 70 artists, activists, and world leaders to defend the planet and defeat poverty."}

The vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury.\"\n\nThe duchess didn't elaborate on the private service, but many people deduced that it wasn't legally binding because of the absence of witnesses.\n\nWelby, who led the couple in their public vows on May 19, 2018, has now shed more light on events.\n\n\"The legal wedding was on the Saturday.

Appearing on the Teenager Therapy podcast in October last year, she said: \"I'm told that in 2019 I was the most trolled person in the entire world, male or female. Now, eight months of that I wasn't even visible, I was on maternity leave or with a baby.\n\n\"But what was able to just be manufactured and churned out, it's almost unsurvivable, that's so big, you can't think of what that feels like, because I don't care if you're 15 or 25, if people are saying things about you that aren't true, what that does to your mental and emotional health is so damaging.\"\n\nArchewell, which they founded last year, does not have an official social media presence. Its aim, according to its website, is to \"unleash the power of compassion to drive systemic cultural change\" by non-profit work and \"creative activations through the business verticals of audio and production\".\n\nThe couple have signed multi-year, multimillion-pound deals with Spotify and Netflix, with plans to produce a podcast series and documentaries.\n\nThe apparent breakaway from social media comes a year after an official statement on the Sussex Royal website said the pair would continue to use those sites in their new roles.\n\nIt said: \"Yes, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to have a social media platform.

It was almost like I was talking to two familiar people that I've known for quite some time.\"\n\nOnce inside, they sampled \"a lot of my favorite things on the menu,\" says Wilson, who opened the soul food eatery in 2005. The pair had their pick of Southern staples, including catfish and collard greens, as well as contemporary twists on old classics like eggnog waffles and spring rolls with black eyed peas.\n\nBut lunch wasn't necessarily the main priority for Meghan, 40, and Harry, 37. The couple specifically requested that Wilson not close the restaurant for a private visit because \"they wanted to be with the people, and that to me was so endearing,\" says Wilson.\n\n\"They took time to engage with other customers who were shocked that they were there ... [they talked] with our service staff, with our chef,\" she adds.\n\n\"What surprised me was how down-to-earth, how comforting, how caring they really are. And it's not what I expected from a royal,\" she says. \"They really are amongst the nicest people I've ever met.\"\n\nBeyond the face time, Harry and Meghan also made sure to pay it forward, leaving a $25,000 donation to Melba's COVID-19 Employee Relief Fund via their Archewell Foundation.\n\nWilson says the money will make a difference amid \"a very challenging time, especially for the food and beverage industry. It's about really providing our employees and other restaurant workers, as well as people that are going through food insecurity during this time of COVID-19 ... with opportunity, making sure that our employees can pay their rent, can pay their bills and also that they have substantial meals.\"\n\nThis work is deeply personal to Wilson, who tells PEOPLE, \"I started out with very, very humble beginnings, and my life is totally about service, whether it's City Harvest or for my Harlem community, my life is fulfilled by giving.\"\n\nShe continues, \"For [the Duke and Duchess] to have heard about us via word of mouth and chose to come there to support a Black, female-owned business is definitely big. But it also shows that people that come from humble beginnings and in urban communities, or any small community, that people see us, they hear what we do, and we're recognized in that way. So it was so much bigger than Melba's, it's about Harlem. It's also about people who have dreams and have vision.\""}

The UK media abides by the Independent Press Standards Organisation's Code of Conduct 'to avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual's race', as well as by rigorous defamation laws. And rightly so – the British press doesn't always get it right. But social media is the Wild West by comparison, publishing vile slurs on a daily basis with impunity.\n\nSome therefore find it strange that such a litigious couple would claim to have been 'silenced' when they have made so many complaints, including resorting to legal action, over stories they claim not to have even read.

Often these are the same charlatans who would think nothing of sidling up to me for the latest gossip on the Royal family, while publicly pretending that reading any such coverage is completely beneath them.\n\nMost pernicious of all though – not least after Piers Morgan's departure from Good Morning Britain following a complaint to ITV and Ofcom from the Duchess – is the corrosive effect this whole hullabaloo is having on freedom of speech. When you've got a former actor effectively editing a British breakfast show from an £11 million Montecito mansion, what next?\n\nI cannot help but think we are in danger of setting race relations back 30 years if people are seriously suggesting that any criticism of Meghan is racially motivated. It's the hypocrisy that gets me. When Priti Patel was accused of bullying, the very same people who willingly hung the Home Secretary out to dry are now the ones defending Meghan against such claims, saying they have been levelled at her simply because she is 'a strong woman of colour'.\n\nOf course journalists should take responsibility for everything they report and be held to account for it – but Harry and Meghan do not have a monopoly on the truth simply because the close friend and neighbour who interviewed them in return for £7 million from CBS took what they said as gospel."}

This time, Sydney Morton and Jordan Dean will play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. While Morton and Dean make the third set of actors to play the Sussexes, many of the people involved haven't changed since the first movie aired in 2018. Notably, Michele Weiss and Merideth Finn have served as co-executive producers for each of the movies. We caught up with Weiss and Finn to find out why they keep recasting, whether there will be another installment, and more. Below, read our entire Q&A with the movie's executive producers.\n\nWhy did you decide to recast Harry and Meghan for each of the three movies?\n\nMW: Well, after the first film—we loved working with Parisa [Fitz-Henley] and with Murray [Fraser]—Parisa actually went off to do a bunch of feature films, so Parisa was just unavailable. So, after that first one we were just sort of put in a position of having to recast.\n\nMF: We were like, \"Nobody could ever do it!\" We were so in love with Parisa and Murray, we were like, \"It's impossible! How will we ever do it?\" But then it's like you're producers; you have to do it. You'll figure it out. Then it was just so exciting to find a new duo who reinvented them in their own way. Then it was like, \"Oh, this is fun.\" We enjoy this part of it. And that couple and that bond they bring with them, that kind of magic that elevates the whole movie.\n\nMW: We were joking that this was going to be like our James Bond. After we had to recast after the first one, we were like OK, well then that's what we're gonna do for each of these movies.\n\nMF: Once we knew we wouldn't have Parisa and Murray, we thought, \"well, let's keep as many of the other people as we can!\" Because we had such a great experience. It was so satisfying to make that first film, and we really loved our team. The director, writer, production designers, and other department heads and supporting cast are all the same. Because we were able to bring back so much of our whole team from the first one, I think it sort of set up this cool thing that happens with these movies when you add that new couple and what they bring to it.\n\nWhen casting parts that are based on real people, are you more focused on resemblance or acting chops?\n\nMW: I would say it is a balance of those things. It's not so much a lookalike, but they do have to remind me in some way of that person. Sometimes it's their voice, sometimes it's their manner. It's that mixed with wanting to get people who are good actors. I think we lucked out because [Sydney Morton and Jordan Dean] are both such good actors—and happened to look like Harry and Meghan.\n\nMF: There are more people than you'd think that look like any of us. When you actually go looking at actors, there are enough people that resemble other people. One might resemble them in one way and another might in another way. Like for example, Sydney's voice is so much like Meghan Markle's voice. I don't think that was particularly true of the other actresses [who played Meghan]. Certainly, each of them did their work to prepare for that role and work their voices, but I think Sydney had that natural Meghan Markle voice. I think that goes a long way with her performance. She doesn't have the stature, she's a tinier person, but there are things she does with the performance that sell you on her version of the Meghan Markle character. I think each of the actresses act on different points of that character.\n\nMW: I think we lucked out in that Sydney and Jordan are both Broadway actors. We didn't find out this out until after we had cast them both, but they had worked together. They were friends and had worked together on American Psycho on Broadway in 2016.\n\nMF: It wasn't something we had planned, but it was like the happiest accident in the world that they already had that chemistry.\n\nHow do you create robust, relatable characters out of figures who have such monitored public personas?\n\nMW: It's true that what they say goes through a process. It's not off the cuff, but they've spoken at events and charities and in circumstances that are important to them. I guess we've sort of felt like we've listened to what they've said. We've really tried to look at what have they chosen to do and say. And there have been a couple of times certainly where they've spoken, and it's been clearly from the heart. And obviously recently with the Oprah interview and things outside of palace purview..."}

But now it seems that contract was, in fact, for a multi-book deal for both the Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle.\n\nAccording to Page Six, who first broke news of the royal couple's foray into the publishing world, their $20 million paycheck is actually for four future books, including one Harry and Meghan are working on together about \"leadership and philanthropy.\" The Duchess of Sussex is also rumored to be working on a memoir of her own, as well as a book on \"wellness.\" And despite reports Harry's memoir would be split in two with a second installment to be published after the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, a spokesperson for the couple confirmed to the outlet just one book is scheduled to be released in late 2022.\n\nIn a statement about the memoir, Harry explained, \"I'm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become. I've worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story—the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned—I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think.

We can be net zero, and this is what we pledge to do.\"\n\nSo what does reaching net zero carbon emissions mean?\n\nAs explained by Archewell, carbon is emitted with almost every human action, from \"what we eat and how often we eat it\" to \"our reliance on big industries that contribute to the problem.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan are committing to make different, more thoughtful every day choices geared at whittling down their carbon footprint as much as possible over time — and, since some carbon emissions are inevitable, investing in carbon removal projects to account for the balance. (For more information, the Sussexes recommend this site.)\n\nFor a prominent couple like the Sussexes, frequent global travel will naturally be one piece of the puzzle. But for anyone, rethinking day-to-day transportation or even something as simple as flipping off light switches (as Prince Charles taught Prince William and Harry to do when they were young boys) can add up toward an overall positive environmental impact.\n\nAmong the partners who will be informing Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, are the Duke's nonprofit organization Travalyst and the Ethic, the sustainable investing platform the couple recently partnered with \"to focus our investments in support of a low-carbon economy.\"\n\nThe Sussexes have been taking on a more vocal role for political and environmental advocacy since stepping back from royal duties in 2020, with Meghan recently penning an open letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to advocate for nationalized paid parental leave — a letter she said she wrote \"on behalf of my family, Archie and Lili and Harry.\"\n\nThe couple also appeared at the recent trip to New York, they met with local and international political leaders and spoke about vaccine equity at Global Citizen Live.\n\nOf course, an escalating push for environmental consciousness and innovative solution-seeking also aligns with recent moves by Harry's family.\n\nPrince William and wife Kate Middleton and Prince William are currently in Glasgow alongside Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, as the top royals make the rounds at COP26 to spur global leaders to action.\n\nWilliam in particular had a busy day on Tuesday, introducing the winners and finalists of his inaugural Earthshot Prize Awards to attendees at the summit.\n\n\"I hope our finalists have given you cause for optimism,\" he told the audience at an event on Tuesday afternoon. \"They represent a growing wave of innovators, dedicating their time and talent to finding solutions to repair our planet.

Meghan, still unused to the palace's rules (and smarting from media criticism), heeds her husband's words as she holds back tears.\n\nAnd while Harry and Meghan's drama was front-and-center in Lifetime's retelling, in real life the new parents were intentionally sidelined in accordance royal protocol.\n\nMeghan \"was not as prominent perhaps as some people might have expected, but there's a pecking order,\" Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine told PEOPLE. \"There was no slight intended, but William being the older, more senior brother would go out [first] with his wife [Kate Middleton].\"\n\nPrince William (Jordan Whalen) and Kate Middleton (Laura Mitchell) with child actors playing Prince Louis, Prince George and Prince Charlotte in Lifetime's Harry & Meghan: Escaping the Palace. Lifetime\n\nA palace source also revealed that the reason for the Sussexes' position stemmed from a more adorable reason: \"There's no one laying this out, telling her where to stand. And there were a lot of kids who everyone would want at the front.\"\n\nMEGHAN'S EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN\n\nFive months before the June Trooping parade, the Duchess had endured a real-life crisis point that she would wait more than two years to share.\n\nThe Duchess revealed in her Emmy-nominated interview with Winfrey that when she and Harry were scheduled to attend a performance at Royal Albert Hall in January 2019, she finally realized she could not ignore suicidal thoughts she later described as \"real and frightening and constant.\"\n\nReflecting on that night years later, Meghan acknowledged, \"I was ashamed to say it at the time and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry. But I knew that if I didn't say it — then I would do it. I just didn't want to be alive anymore.\"\n\nThough Harry offered to attend the event alone, Meghan told him, \"I can't be left alone.\" So they both put on a brave face and carried out their royal duties.\n\nMeghan told Winfrey that when she looks at the photos from the night, she can see Harry's hand tightly gripped around hers: \"[We were] both just trying to hold on.\" After they took their seats and the lights went down in the hall, she says she began \"weeping.\"\n\n\"And that's I think so important for people to remember is you have no idea what's going on for someone behind closed doors. No idea,\" she said. \"Even the people that smile and shine the brightest lights. You need to have compassion for what it actually potentially going on.\"\n\nAs Lifetime movies tend to do, Escaping the Palace took Meghan's revelations one step farther, visually connecting her suicidal ideations to those that Harry's mother, Princess Diana, had confessed in Diana: Her True Story.\n\nMorton told PEOPLE last week, \"There are some interesting parallels, I think, that we draw between Meghan's experience and some of Princess Diana's experience.\"\n\nTHE SUSSEXES' FINAL ROYAL APPEARANCE\n\nLifetime\n\nEscaping the Palace finds plenty of dramatic tension in the couple's last engagement as working royals before their official exit at the end of March 2020. In a private moment, Meghan shows Harry her dazzling green Emilia Wickstead dress, complete with \"superhero cape,\" for the Commonwealth Day service in March 2020.\n\nOnce they convene with the other royals, the film suggests the Sussexes were excluded from the royal procession as retaliation for their impending departure, creating friction between Harry and William (Jordan Whalen). In the film, Kate (Laura Mitchell) smoothes the situation over, and future king William ultimately offers to also forego the procession to appease Harry."}

This one comes courtesy of royal biographer and expert Andrew Morton, who is currently making the rounds doing tons of Sussex-specific press to promote the updated paperback edition of his book .\n\nAccording to Morton, Harry and Meghan passed on a title for their son because of fears that Archie might be bullied if they accepted. Apparently, this was not a general, kids-pick-on-royals fear and a much more specific concern because of the title Archie was in line to inherit.\n\n\"[Archie] could have taken the title 'the Earl of Dumbarton,' which is an honorary title, but [Harry and Meghan] decided against that because they felt that the word 'dumb' in the word 'Dumbarton' would have been used as mockery when Archie went to school,\" Morton told Us Weekly of the Sussexes' supposed reasoning.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in addition to the reason being up for debate, the entire question of whether or not Harry and Meghan were even given a say in Archie's status as a titled royal—honorary or otherwise—is a bit contentious. While early reports did suggest that the couple had made the decision to raise Archie without a title, Meghan offered a much different version of events earlier this year during the Sussexes' sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\n\"They didn't want him to be a prince or a princess, which would be different from protocol,\" Meghan said during the interview. \"It was really hard....This went on for the last few months of our pregnancy where I'm going, 'Hold on a second. How does that work? If he's not gonna be a prince, he needs to be safe.'\"\n\nOf course, Meghan was referring to the possibility of Archie being named a prince, while Morton is discussing an honorary earl title, so it's possible that both of these things are true—i.e., that the Royal Powers That Be denied making Archie a prince and that Harry and Meghan then passed on the honorary title on his behalf."}

The other 5% was financed by the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, according to their website.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced they were stepping down from their duties as senior royals, they said they wanted to achieve financial independence from Prince Harry's family.\n\nAlso known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan clearly found a way to maintain their lifestyle. In June 2020, they purchased a $14.7 million Montecito, California, estate for themselves and their children: Archie, born May 6, 2019, in London, and Lilibet Diana, born June 4, 2021, in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nThey are also responsible for their own personal security, which Forbes estimated could cost as much as $3 million annually.\n\nHere's a look at the pair's current net worths and sources of income as they pursue their independence.\n\nHarry and Meghan Net Worth\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of their move from Great Britain, the couple relied on the $13 million trust Prince Harry inherited from the estate of his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash. Harry received the bulk of the money after his 30th birthday in September 2014.\n\nIn addition, Markle contributed $2 million from her work in TV and films, Forbes reported. She played Rachel Zane on 108 episodes of the television series \"Suits,\" leaving the cast in 2018 before her marriage to Harry.\n\n\"I've got what my mum left me, and without that, we would not have been able to do this,\" Harry told Oprah Winfrey in a March 2021 interview.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current net worth of the Sussexes is not exactly known, but it continues to grow as they sign lucrative contracts in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn September 2020, the Duke and Duchess signed a multiyear, $100 million contract with Netflix to produce documentaries, docuseries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming.\n\n\"Our lives, both independent of each other and as a couple, have allowed us to understand the power of the human spirit: of courage, resilience, and the need for connection,\" the couple said in a statement. \"Through our work with diverse communities and their environments, to shining a light on people and causes around the world, our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives hope.\"\n\nIn April 2021, Harry and Meghan announced the first Netflix project from their production house, Archewell Productions. Titled \"Heart of Invictus,\" the multi-episode series will look at the training of Invictus Games competitors as they prepare for the athletic competition in 2022.\n\nThe Invictus Game Foundation, started in 2014 with Prince Harry as the \"founding patron,\" gives people who have experience \"life-changing injuries or illnesses\" because of their military service a chance to take part in the Olympics-style competition. A release date hasn't been set.\n\nIn December 2020, Prince Harry and his wife expanded their media brand by announcing a partnership with Spotify.

During the Sussexes' interview with Oprah earlier this spring, the couple revealed they are expecting a girl, and the baby is due to arrive sometime this summer.\n\nThis morning, the Duke of Sussex shared a statement paying tribute to his grandfather in which he said: \"My grandfather was a man of service, honour and great humour.

But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end.\n\nHe has been a rock for Her Majesty The Queen with unparalleled devotion, by her side for 73 years of marriage, and while I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'\n\nSo, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself.

Meghan stated in the Oprah interview: 'They didn't want him to be a prince... which would be different from protocol, and [said] that he wasn't going to receive security'.\n\nThe epilogue is said to add that Meghan found doing the interview 'cathartic' and 'liberating', and quotes a friend of hers as alleging that the Royal Family have since taken 'little accountability' for the accusations made against them. The book critiques the way the couple's allegations of racism were handled, comparing it to the action taken after claims of bullying against Meghan, which prompted courtiers to launch an inquiry, with a source stating that 'full ownership was not taken' by the Royal Family to address Meghan's comments.\n\nSocbie and Durand reportedly also make claims about the duke's finances in the run-up to Megxit, stating that Harry and Meghan 'wouldn't have survived' without his inheritance from his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The new edition also explores Harry's struggles with leaving elements of his royal role behind him, stating that he was 'deeply saddened' when he wasn't granted permission to have a wreath laid in his name on Remembrance Sunday last year, on account of no longer being a 'frontline royal'.\n\nThe authors cite the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral as a key moment in shifting the tone of interfamilial relations, with a source claiming that while Harry found the ceremony 'surreal', it brought 'progress' towards reconciliation. The book seeks to shed further light on the relationship between Harry and his older brother and father, claiming that he's spoken to the Duke of Cambridge on a number of occasions, while Harry and Prince Charles are on 'light speaking terms'.\n\nIt's also said that while feelings among the Royal Family remain 'raw' in the wake of the Oprah interview, a source close to the couple claims that 'it will force people to talk in order for the healing to begin', although 'it will take time to get past the hurt', adding: 'There has to be some acknowledgement of understanding about what the Sussexes went through in order for there to be progress'."}

After all, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex just welcomed their baby girl, Lilibet, into the world. What was, however, more on the surprising side was seeing the many other royal members who skipped the annual ceremony at Windsor Castle, including Kate Middleton and Prince William.\n\nAccording to People, this year's festivities only hosted two royals: the Queen and her cousin, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. In the past, the balcony has been filled with royal members including appearances from Prince Charles, Kate Middleton and Prince William along with their children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The traditional event is also known as The Queen's Official Birthday Parade, so it makes sense that many typically gather in celebration of the royal matriarch's big day.\n\nSo what changed this year? Well, similarly to last year's Trooping the Colour ceremony, COVID-19 restrictions prevented the grandeur of the event we usually see."}

And: Where will it be held?\n\nLilibet—whose full name is Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor—was born on June 4, 2021. She is the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's second child after the birth of their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, in May 2019. \"It is with great joy that Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, welcome their daughter, Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, to the world,\" a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said at the time of Lilibet's birth. \"Lili was born on Friday, June 4 at 11:40 a.m. in the trusted care of the doctors and staff at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, CA. She weighed 7 lbs 11 oz.\"\n\nThe couple also confirmed that Lilibet is named after Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II (whose childhood nickname is \"Lilibet\"), and his late mother, Princess Diana. \"Both mother and child are healthy and well, and settling in at home. Lili is named after her great-grandmother, Her Majesty The Queen, whose family nickname is Lilibet,\" the statement continued. \"Her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honor her beloved late grandmother, The Princess of Wales. This is the second child for the couple, who also have a two-year-old son named Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. The Duke and Duchess thank you for your warm wishes and prayers as they enjoy this special time as a family.\"\n\nLilibet's nickname, Lili, is also a nod to Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland, who used to call her daughter, \"Flower,\" when she was younger, according to a past post on Meghan's blog, The Tig. In a statement at the time, Harry and Meghan expressed how \"blessed\" they were for the birth of their daughter. \"On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe. Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family,\" they said.\n\nBut back to Lilibet's christening. When will Lilibet's christening be? Who will be there? And will she be christened at Windsor like her older brother, Archie? Read on ahead for what we know about Lilibet's christening amid Harry and Meghan's continued drama with the British royal family.\n\nWhere is Lilibet's christening?\n\nLilibet's older brother, Archie, was christened at a private chapel at Windsor Castle in July 2019. However, it looks like Lilibet's christening may not take place at the same location. NBC royals correspondent Neil Sean reported in October 2021 that Harry and Meghan wanted Lilibet's christening to be at St. George's Chapel at Windsor (the same venue for their 2018 wedding), so the Queen could attend the ceremony.\"One of the bigger problems that Meghan really encountered of later is that she wanted her daughter, Lilibet Diana, to be christened in the place she was married alongside her husband Prince Harry. And then the christening of her firstborn, Archie,\" Sean said via Express. \"But that came to a grinding halt. Both Harry and Meghan were very keen to make that return and make sure that christening happened, particularly in front of Her Majesty The Queen.\"\n\nAccording to Sean, Harry and Meghan's request was denied by Harry's older brother, Prince William, who told them that Lilibet's christening at Windsor wasn't \"going to work.\" \"But moving forward there was one person who basically decided there wasn't an appetite for this and the person that seemingly is, so far, not willing to kiss and make up with his younger brother,\" Sean said. \"According to a very good source, Prince William was the one who basically said 'no, we don't think this is going to work,' it wasn't a particularly good idea.\""}

Anyone with a base level of knowledge about the royals knows that family drama can't deter Queen Elizabeth II from prioritizing the monarchy, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal exit ~dramz~ was no exception.\n\nRoyal author Matthew Dennison breaks down the Queen's behind-the-scenes reaction to Harry and Meghan's decision to step back from royal life (and move across the pond to California) in his new book . In an early excerpt from the book (which is set to be released September 1) published by Us Weekly, Dennison said that \"Elizabeth was hurt and disappointed\" by the Sussexes' decision but she didn't let that affect her monarchy-first mindset.\n\n\"Elizabeth's official statement expressed loving finality: 'It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.' It was an attempt to reassert control in the interests of damage limitation and a decisive but dark beginning to a new decade,\" Dennison writes. \"Elizabeth had never been a sentimental woman; she had acted in the only way she understood.\"\n\nDennison also included a little context (you know, for any royal readers out there who haven't seen season 1 of The Crown) and explained why the Queen forced Harry and Meghan to make a clean break from royal duties instead of letting them continue to do some engagements.\n\n\"As throughout a life in which she had consistently honored her father's belief that 'the highest of distinctions is the service of others,' she had placed the monarchy first, safeguarding its mission of service and duty that could never, she was certain, be a part-time calling,\" he writes in the excerpt.\n\nOf course, it should go without saying (but maybe doesn't, so here we are, saying it explicitly) that \"putting the monarchy first\" and \"still loving and supporting Harry and Meghan\" are not mutually exclusive, and the Queen has made it abundantly clear that the latter is very much the case several times since the royal exit."}

The Sussexes sat down with Oprah a few months ago and detailed their sadness at being stripped of security and hearing that their son, Archie, would not have a title. They spoke about a family member musing as to how \"dark\" Archie would be while Meghan was pregnant. Meghan also revealed that she struggled with suicidal ideation while confined to palace grounds, and suggested the royal family denied her the life-saving mental healthcare she so desperately needed.\n\nIn the shocking interview, Harry and his wife made it very clear — they left the Royal Family to save Meghan's life, protect themselves and their children from racism, and flee the tyranny of British tabloids.\n\nAt first glance, this may seem like it has nothing to do with Queen Elizabeth. In fact, Meghan and her husband were effusive about the Queen's support of them in the Oprah interview. But the Queen has a great deal of power when it comes to family affairs. For instance, several of Archie's relatives — including Zara Phillips, daughter of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips — do not have titles. But according to the family, this was a deliberate choice made by their parents. Meghan and Harry made it clear that they were not given a choice; they were merely informed."}

That's one of the central questions of a new two-part documentary, The Princes and the Press, that aired on the BBC last night.\n\nThe obvious suspect is the dreaded British media — barging, intrusive, xenophobic — riddled with prejudice, we're told, against a mixed-race American in the monarchy. But the jostling between royal households seems equally responsible. After the early days of Hazza and Megz, a clear jealousy from some of William and Kate's people began to seep into the media.

'Work-shy William' and 'waity Katie' were left looking like yesterday's royals.\n\nToday, Kate and Wills are the PR golden couple while it's all gone wrong for Harry and Meghan. What happened? Like all media darlings, eventually less favourable coverage began to surface (not least from Meghan's father). There were allegations that she was difficult to deal with, that courtiers were unhappy and leaving in droves — something that her lawyer, given specific permission to speak to the BBC, expressly denied. Then there was so-called tiara-gate, where Meghan was supposedly refused royal jewellery, an incident that resulted in either her or her royal fiance being marched in before the Queen. It is worth noting too, that much of this gossip initially went unreported. Dan Wootton, then of the Sun, explained that it took a good six months before these whispers appeared in the press.

More than 1 million customers were without electricity immediately after the storm - a hardship that, for some, could last weeks.\n\nEntergy Corp (ETR.N) the largest Louisiana utility, is facing tough questions on whether it had done enough to harden the electric system, which lost eight major transmission lines delivering power to the New Orleans metropolitan area.\n\nEntergy was in the midst of upgrades throughout its system after Hurricane Laura in 2020. From 2017 to 2019, Entergy's Louisiana subsidiary spent about $1.2 billion on numerous projects to improve its transmission system.\n\nA pivotal question now for Entergy and its consumers is how well those capital improvements survived the hurricane's wrath compared to the company's older infrastructure. Entergy declined to detail the age of the eight New Orleans-area transmission lines that failed.\n\n\"The reason the lights are out is not because we aren't building a resilient system,\" said Rod West, Entergy's group president of utility operations. \"The lights are out because Mother Nature is still the undisputed, undefeated heavyweight champion of the world.\"\n\nHurricane Laura in southwest Louisiana highlighted how Entergy operates a transmission network with two different design standards for resisting wind damage. Transmission lines and infrastructure built in recent years are rated to withstand 140-mph winds, and in some cases up to 150 mph gusts, according to Entergy disclosures with Louisiana utility regulators.\n\nBut large sections of Entergy's Louisiana network were designed to withstand wind speeds far below what Ida delivered. About one-sixth of Entergy Louisiana's transmission system, covering about 900 miles, consists of 69-kilovolt lines, the majority of which are only rated at 95 mph, according to Entergy disclosures to regulators.\n\nThe 1970s-era design standard, which was used in building part of the network that feeds New Orleans, is a holdover from when Gulf States Utilities operated the transmission system, according to Entergy disclosures to Louisiana regulators.\n\nMany structures on the legacy system were destroyed last year during Hurricane Laura, according to testimony submitted by Entergy executives this year to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The company has asked regulators to approve more than $500 million to repair and rebuild damaged transmission lines from 2020 hurricanes, a cost that would be shouldered by ratepayers in their monthly electric bills.\n\nThree years after Entergy merged with Gulf States in 1994, the company implemented a more robust design for the transmission network that met or exceeded the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) standard. But the network still includes lines built to the older, lower standard because they complied with NESC codes at the time they were constructed.\n\nThat leaves the network more vulnerable to outages, said Praveen Malhotra, an engineer and expert on catastrophe risk who has studied hurricane effects on transmission systems.\n\n\"The whole system is only as strong as the weakest link,\" Malhotra said.\n\nEntergy said in a statement that much of the damage from Ida was related to the high winds, causing several lines to become detached from their structures. The eight transmission tie lines that were rendered inoperable are vital because they connect the integrated transmission system in the greater New Orleans area to the larger national grid."}

But the three recent storms — all within the last decade — seem to underline Murphy's point.\n\nThe governor declined on Thursday to provide details about the deaths from Ida, but he and other public officials spent the day making the case for enhancing the country's infrastructure to try and limit the damage from future storms.\n\nThe frequency and intensity of storms may have played a role in Ida, Murphy said. Many areas were still saturated from Tropical Storm Henri less than two weeks ago, he said, leading to severe flooding."}

Christina Stephens, a spokesperson for Gov. John Bel Edwards, said that given the level of destruction, \"We're going to have many more confirmed fatalities.\"\n\nThe governor's office said damage to the power grid appeared \"catastrophic\" — dispiriting news for those without refrigeration or air conditioning during the dog days of summer, with highs forecast in the mid-80s to near 90 by midweek."}

They are producing more rainfall, moving slower once they make landfall and generating larger storm surges along the coast. Hurricane Ida was a prime example of those changes, and scientists say storms like this will become more common as the planet warms.\n\nFueled by warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ida destroyed homes, uprooted trees and cut off power to more than 1 million residents. It battered Mississippi and the already storm-ravaged state of Louisiana, and officials there say they expect the death toll to increase in the coming days.\n\nHurricane Ida was just the latest in back-to-back storms that have slammed Louisiana in recent years. But Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and professor at Texas Tech University, said an important distinction is not the frequency of the storms but their severity.\n\n\"We've always had hurricanes, we've always had heat waves, we've always had floods and droughts, but what climate change is doing is loading the weather dice against us,\" Hayhoe told CNN. \"It's sneaking in when we're not looking, changing the numbers as we're rolling and asking what is this, how could this happen?\"\n\n\"The answer to that is climate change,\" she said.\n\nHurricanes are getting stronger\n\nHurricanes — also called tropical cyclones or typhoons outside North America — are being made more intense by the warming ocean, which studies have shown has absorbed approximately 90% of the planet's excess heat trapped by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. And a recent study found that the planet is trapping roughly double the amount of heat than it did nearly 15 years ago.\n\nAs the planet heats up, storms get stronger.\n\nThe recent state-of-the-science United Nations report on climate change concluded that the global proportion of cyclones ranging from Category 3 to 5 — the most intense storms — has increased over the last four decades due to rapidly warming ocean temperatures. For every additional degree of warmth, scientists say not only will the proportion of intense cyclones continue to climb, but extreme rain events are also forecast to intensify by about 7%.\n\n\"We know that, in general, hurricanes are intensifying faster,\" Hayhoe said. \"They are bigger and stronger than they would be otherwise; they have a lot more rainfall associated with them, and rising sea level exacerbates storm surge.\"\n\nBefore making landfall on Sunday, Hurricane Ida went through a remarkable period of strengthening: its maximum sustained winds increased by 65 mph in just 24 hours.\n\nScientists define rapid intensification — a process that historically has been rare — as an increase of 35 mph in 24 hours or less. Hurricane Ida nearly doubled that definition.\n\nFor rapid intensification to occur, warm ocean water must extend well below the surface, going hundreds of feet deep, to provide enough engine for the hurricane to strengthen. This has led scientists to believe that storms are more likely to undergo rapid intensification as a result of warmer oceans.\n\n\"If you increase the speed limit, you make more room for the storms to strengthen, so it can intensify more quickly,\" Jim Kossin, a senior scientist with the Climate Service, an organization that provides climate risk analysis to governments and businesses, told CNN.\n\nIda made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4, and is now tied in the record books with Laura in 2020 as the strongest hurricane to make landfall there.\n\nHurricanes are wetter and moving slower\n\nHighway 51 was flooded on Monday by Hurricane Ida near LaPlace, Louisiana. Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advert/USA TODAY Network\n\nStorms are also generating more rainfall. For every degree of warming, the atmosphere can hold 7% more water vapor that could fall as rain. After flooding from Hurricane Harvey devastated the Houston area in 2017, scientists found that human-caused climate change supercharged the storm's rainfall by approximately 15%.\n\nHurricane Ida has dumped more than 15 inches of rain on parts of Louisiana, according to the National Weather Service. As the remnants of the storm arc from the South to New England, another 3 to 7 inches of rain is expected across at least 12 states, including areas already impacted by severe flooding this month such as Tennessee and New Jersey.\n\nPaul Miller, a coastal meteorology scientists at Louisiana State University, said southeast Louisiana, including Baton Rouge and New Orleans, experienced one of its wettest seasons on record. According to Miller, it rained on 91% of the days between June 18 and July 19 at the New Orleans airport, compared to the region's average of 40-50%.\n\n\"It's been a historically wet year in southeast Louisiana even before Ida,\" he told CNN. \"This really exacerbated concerns about flooding during Ida because the ground had already absorbed a lot of water this year.\"\n\nSatellite data also shows that storms are getting slower, particularly after they make landfall, according to Hayhoe. Slower and larger storms means they can cover a greater area, idle and dump more rain during that time period.\n\nAnd, while experts say the research is still developing, a 2020 study published in the journal Nature found storms are staying stronger farther inland than they did five decades ago. Since hurricanes are fueled by warm ocean water, they tend to weaken over land, but in recent years they have been raging longer after landfall. The study concludes that warmer sea surface temperatures are leading to a \"slower decay\" by increasing the amount of moisture that a hurricane can carry.\n\nStorm surge is getting higher\n\nStorm surge, the flooding that occurs when hurricane winds push ocean water over land, is also getting worse due to sea level rise. Hayhoe said storm surge can inundate a larger area now than it would from a hurricane of the same intensity about 50 or 100 years ago."}

Picking up intensity overnight as it moved over warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, it hit the Louisiana coast as a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nWhat started as a disturbance in the Atlantic Ocean quickly grew to what could be the worst hurricane to hit Louisiana since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. While scientists are uncertain whether climate change will increase the frequency of hurricanes, one thing is clear: Climate change is here, and it's making these storms stronger and more destructive.\n\n\"Until recently, it was common to think of climate change as a problem for future generations, saying people in the future will have to deal with it,\" said Andrew Dessler, a professor in the College of Geosciences at Texas A&M University. \"But now it's quite clear that we are the people of the future. The future has arrived, and we are having to deal with it now.\"\n\nBe it Hurricane Ida or the wildfires that continue to burn across California, climate change is making disasters more destructive, more expensive and more impactful on humans, he said.\n\nAccording to the United Nation's latest climate report published earlier this month, it is \"unequivocal\" that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land, and it's already affecting weather and climate extremes around the world. Dessler calls the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change a confirmation of what scientists have suspected for decades.\n\nHe explains that the effects of climate change on storm severity manifests in several ways. Most obviously, rising sea levels have led to higher storm surges. Hotter temperatures create more water vapor in the atmosphere, which in turn means more rainfall. Perhaps less intuitively, he said, warmer water also means stronger winds. It all makes for a more destructive hurricane, as was the case with Ida.\n\nTake Hurricanes Laura, Michael and Harvey, for example, which hit the U.S. in just the last few years. Before Harvey, he said, a storm producing 60 inches of rain over the course of a three or four days would have been \"unimaginable.\"\n\n\"Whether we get storms that more rapidly intensify is something that people have been talking about in the last few years,\" he said. \"A lot of scientists believe that's something else we'll get. We'll get these storms that look anemic offshore and then spin up into monsters in 24 or 48 hours.\"\n\nWith little advance notice, this would make it increasingly difficult for decision makers at the local and state levels to evacuate residents and deploy first responders. It takes a city about 72 hours to prepare for a disaster to hit, Dessler said.\n\n\"If this starts to happen more and more frequently, if you start having these storms that intensify extremely rapidly, it's going to make it very hard for people to respond to the storms in ways they could respond if they had a week's warning,\" he said.\n\nIn Louisiana, hundreds of thousands of people are still without power, and Gov. John Bel Edwards has told evacuees not to return until infrastructure is restored. Dessler said one growing concern is that another disaster could come in the form of a heat wave."}

As a result of the hurricane, 96% of crude oil production and 94% of natural gas production in the U.S. federally administered areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) were shut in, according to estimates by the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. At least nine refineries shut down or reduced production. As a result, we reduced our forecast for crude oil production and refinery runs in our September Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).\n\nWe revised down our estimate for U.S. crude oil production in the GOM in August by 0.2 million barrels per day (b/d) from the August STEO to 1.5 million b/d in the September STEO. We reduced our forecast of production in the GOM for September by 0.5 million b/d from the August STEO to 1.2 million b/d in the September STEO. We expect that disrupted GOM crude oil production will return through September, increasing to our previously forecast levels in October. Last year, the GOM accounted for 15% of U.S. crude oil production.\n\nAccording to our Weekly Petroleum Status Report, gross inputs into Gulf Coast refineries fell by 1.6 million b/d from the week ending August 27 to the week ending September 3. Although some refiners have resumed operations or begun the process for restarting, we expect refinery runs will average 713,000 b/d lower in September than they would have without the disruptions.\n\nRepairs to any infrastructure required to resume refinery operations, however, could potentially take longer, making the forecast highly uncertain. We forecast that average crude oil inputs into refineries later this year will be mostly unchanged from our previous August STEO forecast.\n\nFrom August 27 to September 3, our Weekly Petroleum Status Report data indicate crude oil inventories in the Gulf Coast fell by 2.6 million barrels and U.S. crude oil production fell by 1.5 million b/d. Over the same period, crude oil imports into the Gulf Coast fell by 247,000 b/d to 787,000 b/d. U.S. crude oil exports, which are mostly exported from the Gulf Coast, fell by 698,000 b/d over the same period."}

Phil Murphy said. At least 13 people were killed in New York City, police said, 11 of them in flooded basement apartments, which often serve as relatively affordable homes in one of the nation's most expensive housing markets. Suburban Westchester County reported three deaths.\n\nOfficials said at least five people died in Pennsylvania, including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape. A Connecticut state police sergeant, Brian Mohl, perished after his cruiser was swept away. Another death was reported in Maryland.\n\nSophy Liu said she tried using towels and garbage bags to stop the water coming into her first-floor New York City apartment, but the flood rose to her chest in just a half hour. She roused her son from bed, put him in a life jacket and inflatable swimming ring and tried to flee, but the door stuck. She called two friends who helped her jar it loose.\n\n\"I was obviously scared, but I had to be strong for my son. I had to calm him down,\" she recalled Thursday as medical examiners removed three bodies from a home down her Queens street.\n\nIn another part of Queens, water rapidly filled Deborah Torres' first-floor apartment to her knees as her landlord frantically urged her neighbors below — among them a toddler — to get out, she said. But the water rushed in so strongly that she surmised they weren't able to open the door. The three residents died.\n\n\"I have no words,\" she said. \"How can something like this happen?\"\n\nIda's soggy remnants merged with a storm front and soaked the Interstate 95 corridor, meteorologists said.

Nearby houses are disconnected from their foundations, a refrigerator is lodged sideways in a tree, and dozens of caskets and tombs from two nearby cemeteries are strewn across lawns for blocks. The entire town is without power and running water.\n\nA month after Hurricane Ida roared ashore with 150-mph (241-kph) winds, communities all along the state's southeastern coast — Ironton, Grand Isle, Houma, Lafitte and Barataria — are still suffering from the devastating effects of the Category 4 storm.\n\nMany, like Trufant Salvant, are bunking with relatives until they can get back into their homes. Others are staying in hotels or have left the state, she said.

Donations have been slow to trickle in compared to previous storms, even smaller ones, and there's not enough to meet the demand, Williamson said.\n\nWhen it comes to tarps and cleaning supplies — bleach, buckets, mops and rakes — \"we can't get enough of them,\" he said.\n\nThe United Way is also managing unique cases including that of firefighter Warren Myers, whose 5-year-old special needs daughter, Ameah, requires a specific formula administered through a feeding tube, medicine to control seizures, and diapers, all of which are expensive and have been hard to get since Ida.\n\nStore shelves haven't been as well stocked, and deliveries haven't arrived as regularly as usual, said Crystal Hagger, Myers' fiancée, who helps care for Ameah.\n\nAmeah is unable to stand or walk on her own, so the couple carry her everywhere either in their arms or on their backs with a harness-style carrier.\n\nThe family was recently told the United Way found a donor willing to fit Ameah for a pediatric wheelchair.\n\n\"Every little act of kindness goes a long way,\" Hagger said, her voice choked with emotion. \"We are very grateful.\"\n\nThe need is visually evident everywhere.\n\nIn Ironton, Trufant Salvant's house is one of only about eight in her neighborhood not swamped by Ida's floodwaters. After Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, she was able to raise her home, which now sits 12 feet (3.6 meters) off the ground.

They've fought off a devastating oil spill, floods, changing markets and endless hurricanes just to stay in business.\n\nAfter Hurricane Ida, though, some wonder about their ability to continue in a seemingly endless cycle of recovery and readjustment.\n\nThe Category 4 hurricane that struck Louisiana late last month fractured some parts of the industry even worse than 2005's Katrina, which cost seafood businesses more than $1 billion. No one yet knows how many boats, docks and processors were lost because of Ida's relentless, 150-mph winds. Vessels that made it to the safest harbors fared the best, yet even some of them were destroyed by the storm's fury.\n\nLt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, whose office oversees seafood promotion, said some areas, like Lafitte, were all but wiped out. The damage is a devastating blow to people whose entire lives are intertwined with fishing and the Gulf Coast.\n\n\"This thing just seemed to beat and beat and beat, kind of mixing it up like a washing machine,\" Nungesser said. \"I think that slow-moving storm beating these boats against the docks, against each other, caused a lot more vessels to sink and have major damage.\"\n\nThe story of Ida's impact on Louisiana's $2.4 billion seafood industry, which employs more than 23,000 at last count, is unfolding across places that outsiders struggle to even pronounce: Parishes like Plaquemines, Lafourche, and Terrebonne, cities and hamlets including Pointe-aux-Chenes, Des Allemandes and Houma. There, seafood families go back generations.\n\nThe people who make their living off the Gulf bounty are pledging to come back again this time provided another hurricane doesn't wipe them out first. But there are other challenges ahead as Louisiana tries to save a vanishing coastline, an industry and a way of life, all at the same time.\n\nRAINING INSIDE\n\nThe ferocious wind from Hurricane Ida tore off so much of the roof of Motivatit Seafoods that it rained inside the oyster plant in Houma when squalls from Hurricane Nicholas blew through two weeks later, ruining expensive processing equipment. Across a parking lot, Ida reduced the company's maintenance shop to a crumpled heap of metal.\n\n\"This is at least 20 times worse than we've ever had,\" said Steven Voisin, who runs the 50-year-old family business founded by his late brother and father. \"It could have been worse, but it doesn't matter. The buildings are to the extent of not really being able to be reused.\"\n\nOyster production already was down in Louisiana because of hurricanes and the BP oil spill of 2010, and several years of bad flooding virtually wiped out some areas where the shellfish grew, partly because a major spillway had to be opened in 2019, Voisin said.\n\n\"Where this state was out-producing all other states combined in the past, now we're just another state with a few oysters,\" he said."}

Several electrical transformers blew early in the day, and the Entergy transmission tower that provides power to almost the entire city collapsed into the Mississippi River later in the evening, which could leave the entire city without electricity for days, if not weeks. The loss of power also deprived the city's water pumps of the energy they needed to push rainwater out of the city, which forced the local board to rely on what it called \"self-generated power\" and a single turbine. As the night wore on, the water kept rising. It was still unclear by morning how long it would take to restore power.\n\nWhile the full toll of the storm remains to be seen, it's not too early to perceive the broader lesson here: We now live in a world for which our current ways of building and living are inadequate. We have underestimated the risk posed by disasters like hurricanes and wildfires, and we must now rethink our relationship to the natural forces that terrorize marginalized communities like Naquin's.

Ida made its earliest landfall at Port Fourchon, a marine complex that services about 20 percent of the nation's oil supply; given the potential for hurricane damage to affect gas prices, it is a safe bet that officials will devote extensive early resources to restoring the port's operations. Although most oil production in the region has moved offshore, Louisiana is still a stronghold for the petrochemical industry, and the swath of land the hurricane traversed is home to an estimated 600 refineries and chemical plants; there are dozens of these plants along the spine of the Mississippi River in Plaquemines Parish and hundreds more in \"Cancer Alley,\" the cluster of polluted refinery towns between New Orleans and Lafayette.

Another felt like she was inside a meteor shower.\n\nOne of the most powerful hurricanes in the nation's history was barreling into south Louisiana. Fifty miles (80 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, the staff at Leonard J.

A giant metal beam tore off the building and thumped into a glass door, over and over, like a battering ram. The medical staff prepared to keep patients on ventilators alive by hand if the worst were to happen.\n\nHurricane Ida was colliding with the country's out-of-control pandemic. Hospitals facing a Category 4 storm typically either evacuate or discharge as many patients as possible. But this time, amid the community's fourth, brutal surge of COVID, many of Chabert Medical Center's patients were too sick to be sent home. And hospitals that lay outside the hurricane's most destructive path were too full of COVID patients to absorb any more. So here they stayed — nurses, doctors, paramedics — exhausted from battling one catastrophe, watching through the windows as a second one tore into town with 150 mph (240 kph) winds.\n\n\"The mental stress on our employees is much worse now than it's ever been,\" said Richard Zuschlag, the owner of Acadian Ambulance Service, the state's largest emergency medical outfit. \"COVID set us up for that. And the hurricane is the icing on the cake.\"\n\nSome nurses wept. The staff stood in a hallway, held hands and asked God to protect them. They feared any minute the building might collapse.\n\nAcross town, huge sections of the roof blew off Terrebonne General Health System, the largest hospital in Terrebonne Parish, whose bayous brimming with sinewy cypress trees run through the region like veins. Water poured in so quickly it looked like it was raining inside. The windows shattered, the walls shook and it sounded like a freight train.\n\nAs the hours passed, some nurses began asking the same question about the storm that they'd been pondering about the pandemic for months: \"When is this ever going to end?\"\n\nBy the time the sun came up, both hospitals in Houma had endured so much damage, they had to coordinate a massive evacuation.\n\nDr. Chuck Burnell, the chief medical officer of Acadian Ambulance, was in the basement of Terrebonne General sorting out how to move more than 100 patients, many of them infected with COVID, some on ventilators.\n\nBurnell has been an emergency physician for almost 30 years, and he said this is among the worst storms he's been through, arriving as it did just as the state's COVID deaths soared and its vaccination rate remained among the lowest in the country."}

The hub provides information on available assistance programs and where to find services such as shelter and access to food. Information on the site will be updated as more resources for New Yorkers become available. Additionally, the State is partnering with New York City to support Recovery Service Centers, which enlist the support of elected officials who represent impacted communities and provide information on available resources and assistance.\n\nGovernor Hochul also directed that $378 million in previously awarded hazard mitigation funding from FEMA be devoted to bolstering New York State's infrastructure against extreme weather."}

Now, nonprofits including Habitat for Humanity are sending out an appeal for volunteers and donors to help get the area back on track.\n\nA town destroyed\n\nAlthough Jean Lafitte sits just 22 miles south of downtown New Orleans, Hurricane Ida's impact on each city was completely different. While New Orleans dealt with flooding and a nearly two-week power outage, many residents in Jean Lafitte lost everything.\n\n\"A big portion of Lafitte became homeless overnight,\" said Kerner who told CNN the town was placed in a vulnerable position years earlier following Hurricane Katrina \"when the federal government decided to build levees around the entire region besides our area.\"\n\n\"The decision to build levees all around us leaves all the water to fill up here.\"\n\nHurricane Ida brought a little of everything to the town.\n\n\"We had the water, we had the wind. So people had significant water damage. Not only that, you had 4 feet of mud in people's homes,\" Kerner explained.\n\nThe town, which sits on the Mississippi River Delta, did have a state-run ring levee system built around it, but it wasn't enough for Hurricane Ida.\n\nMany residents like Benny Alexie bore the brunt of the storm. Alexie's home was washed onto the nearby highway.\n\n\"It took me 40 years to get where I was,\" said Alexie. \"It only took a matter of hours to lose it all.\"\n\n\"What this community has endured has been just so unjust,\" explained Kerner.\n\n\"Our most vulnerable people are priced out of insurance and don't qualify for FEMA.\"\n\nSome residents didn't qualify for FEMA assistance due to lack of proof of occupancy because of informal inheritance of homes; others had paid insurance claims that were insufficient to repair and protect their homes long-term.\n\nKerner said that although there's been some progress in the last few months, recovery for so many Jean Lafitte citizens could take years.\n\n\"They need funds; they need people to come to help build the homes and put their roofs back together.\"\n\nHabitat for Humanity dedicated to long-term recovery\n\nHabitat for Humanity has been on the ground since the hurricane struck, distributing tarps and other supplies to help the community protect what remains of their homes from further damage.\n\n\"That's not where habitat really shines,\" said Marguerite Oestreicher, executive director of the New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity.\n\n\"It's long-term recovery and helping people figure out a path to rebuilding.\"\n\nOestreicher said Jean Lafitte is the type of community where neighbors are helping neighbors in their time of need.\n\n\"Right now, everyone is hurting, and the amount of work to be done is just overwhelming.\"\n\nThis is why volunteers are essential.\n\n\"Those are the extra hands,\" Oestreicher explained. \"Those are the people who can come in; they can muck and gut, and they don't have to be skilled carpenters in order to be helpful.\"\n\nNew Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity recently reopened its doors to new volunteers. Since the coronavirus pandemic, only core or long-time volunteers like Dennis Kehoe have been on work sites. Kehoe has volunteered with the nonprofit since 1991. He said the work can be a unifying experience.\n\n\"It's not just building houses, but it's a ministry to teach people about volunteering and community involvement,\" said Kehoe.\n\n\"I think it is important for communities to come together and show solidarity.\"\n\nVolunteers and donations needed\n\nVolunteers and financial support can help families in the Jean Lafitte area get back on track."}

But the remnants of the tropical storm threaten to hinder the town as it tries to trudge forward.\n\nGretchen Turner cleaned and power washed her garage to prepare for the few inches of rain coming her way. On Monday, Turner, 59, continued the grueling task of deciding what few belongings she wanted to salvage -- what was most dear to her. She's covering whatever else she can with tarps.\n\n\"It's sort of demoralizing when you're working so hard and then everything gets wet,\" Turner said with glossing eyes. \"...We still have lots of dirt everywhere, but its about to be mud again, you know. So things are gonna get just dirty again.\"\n\nThe wood that made Gretchen Turner's home, along with the kitchen cabinets, the leather couch, the suitcases, nearly everything that once lived inside has been gutted. It's now piled onto her front lawn.\n\n\"There's no point in tarping this,\" Turner said pointing to the growing pile of her destroyed furniture and belongings. \"I wish they'd pick it up.\"\n\nIn the last four days, volunteer agencies, the National Guard and the Tennessee Department of Transportation have hauled over 800 truck loads of debris to a landfill in Humphreys County, said Grey Collier, spokesperson for the the county's Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAs the remnants of Ida head toward town, Collier said the agencies will continue to remove debris, including what's lodged in the creek. The hope is to prevent any blockage that could cause the creek to swell.\n\n\"It shouldn't be a problem, but I kind of feel like everybody in those areas might have a little bit of post traumatic going on,\" Collier said. \"And just with rain coming in, that might, you know trigger a little bit of nervousness.\"\n\nMost hope that the coming rain won't spur any more physical damage to the town, but emotionally-- it's been done. While volunteers continues to work toward rebuilding, many are exhausted.\n\nAs people linger in Waverly Café, a coffeehouse in the center of town, owner Scott Daniel is able to take a pulse on how his neighbors are dealing with the disaster in front of them.\n\n\"It comes in waves,\" he said. \"They'll be good, then they'll have those little breakdowns, because it is just overwhelming. They're still lost and not really sure where to go or what to do.\"\n\nWaverly Police Department will be keeping an eye on the creek and is prepared to help families leave their homes if they need to, although they don't expect that evacuation will be necessary, said Grey Collier, spokesperson for the Humphreys County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nDespite the minimal expected rainfall, some have a plan set in case the rain escalates, like it did last Saturday.\n\n\"I already got my bag packed and everything so I'm ready to roll,\" said Tara Anthony, whose home was damaged by the flood. \"You never know.\""}

John Bel Edwards and local officials about the hurricane, providing the president with a tough test just after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.\n\nThe fifth most powerful hurricane to strike the United States came ashore in southern Louisiana on Sunday, knocking out power for more than a million customers and water for another 600,000 people, creating miserable conditions for the afflicted, who were also enduring suffocating heat and humidity.\n\nThe hurricane struck the Gulf coast and carved a northern path through the eastern United States, culminating in torrential rains and widespread flooding in New York, New Jersey and surrounding areas. At least nine deaths were reported in Louisiana, with at least another 46 killed along the East Coast.\n\n\"This storm has been incredible, not only here but all over the East Coast,\" Biden said during a meeting with officials.\n\n\"I know you've got to be frustrated about the restoration of power,\" he said, adding the government was working \"24/7\" with electric companies and supplying generators.\n\nPower restoration efforts continue\n\nThe number of homes and businesses without power in Louisiana fell to around 823,000 on Friday as electric utility Entergy Corp said it had restored service to about 225,000 customers.\n\nWhile Biden toured Louisiana, the New York area was still dealing with crippling floods from Ida.\n\nNew Jersey Gov.

The ongoing disruptions have hampered exports and raised crude prices, as Asian buyers searched for substitutes for the popular Gulf Mars grade.\n\nThree weeks after the storm, about 40% of Shell's production from the offshore region is still offline. Shell is the largest U.S. Gulf producer with eight facilities pumping about 476,000 bpd, according to researcher Rystad Energy. Overall, the U.S. Gulf produces 1.8 million bpd, or about 16% of U.S. oil output.\n\nCONTRACTS SUSPENDED\n\nShell's damaged transfer facility, West Delta-143, carries oil and gas from three major fields for processing at onshore terminals. The company previously suspended numerous contracts to supply crude from the fields, citing hurricane losses. read more\n\nThe fields are a key source of Mars sour crude, a grade prized by oil refiners in the United States and Asia. Rystad analyst Artem Abramov estimated the lost production will remove 200,000 to 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Gulf of Mexico oil supply for several months.\n\n\"Disruptions are now having an impact on total available crude for export from the U.S., not just the offshore grades,\" said Krista Kuhl, an analyst with consultancy firm Facts Global Energy.\n\nMars prices had soared to a one-year high this month then eased as other oil supply constraints lifted. On Friday, the grade traded at a $2 per barrel discount to the U.S. benchmark , down from a premium. read more\n\n\"Based on current pricing there is likely to be much less crude exported,\" Kuhl added.\n\nA Shell spokesman declined to comment further.\n\n2022 RESTARTS\n\nShell's Mars and Ursa oilfields, which supply about 200,000 bpd combined, would be affected into the first quarter of next year. The third oilfield, Olympus, produces about 100,000 bpd and will be able to resume production sometime in the fourth quarter, Shell said.\n\nAbout 18% of the U.S. Gulf's oil and 27% of its natural gas production remained offline on Monday, more than three weeks after Hurricane Ida, regulator Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said.\n\nMars crude exports averaged 150,000 bpd in the first eight months of 2021, accounting for about 5.5% of total U.S. crude exports of 2.75 million bpd, according to data from Kpler.

Police and fire dispatchers worked to handle hundreds of calls for crews to perform water rescues in places where there should be no water.\n\nOn the Yonkers-Bronxville line, the Sprain Brook Parkway was strewn with cars abandoned by their drivers, sitting in water up to their door handles and higher.\n\nIn Rockland County, floodwaters force the New York State Thruway to close in both directions, the highway not high enough.\n\nRain fell in buckets: nearly 9 inches in Mount Kisco; more than 6 inches in Wappingers Falls; nearly 6 in Vails Gate in Orange County; more than 5 inches in Suffern.

After all, his SUV was larger. But the car in front stopped. And Alfalahi stopped. Then his engine stalled and would not start again.\n\nHe stopped in the glow of a stoplight, the wind whipping the rain in sheets.\n\nHe opened the door and water rushed in, colder than he would have thought. It continued to rush in, even after he shut the door. Before he knew it, the floodwaters had reached the steering wheel.\n\nHe opened the window and climbed up to stand in the open space, to figure out his next step, which would be a wet one no matter where he took it.\n\nAcross the street, Cindy Finegan was watching.

The river surrounded Finegan's neighbors' homes and found its way into their basements through closed windows, leaving 8 to 10 feet of water, she said. It was like the water was coming up through the tile and grout, she said.\n\nBut that was downstairs. At the moment, Finegan was looking at the man swimming across her street, and walking, wading home.\n\nWhen someone asked for directions to help a sick woman get to New Rochelle, the driver saw that Alfalahi was shivering and offered to give him a ride. They found closed roads at every turn and, eventually, the tired detective ended up walking home after sending them on their way.\n\nWhen he walked in his door, it was 11 p.m. He was waterlogged and shivering.\n\nThe next day, Thursday, Alfala was back on Wolfs Lane, waiting for a tow truck, when Finegan walked over to talk to the man who had swam. This being 2021, she showed him the photo she had taken of him, contemplating his next soggy step. She got his number, and texted it to him.\n\nBecause who would believe a guy who says he swam across the street, if he didn't have proof?\n\nThe day after\n\nAcross the Hudson Valley, those residents who were able to sleep overnight Wednesday — those not kept awake anxiously watching the floodwaters near their houses, to their houses, into their houses — woke Thursday to a bright blue sky reflected in the murky remains of Ida.

But from what I just got off the phone when I was interrupted earlier, the water's still piling in. So I don't know where it's going to stop. And, you know, I'm 70 years old. I grew up back there and I've never seen anything like this. This is a storm from the left side of Lafitte. Everybody knows that it would be bad. But, you know, this is a Cat 4, from what I understand is still a Cat 4. This is going to be a nightmare.\n\nSC: And I take it you're getting calls from residents as well. What are you hearing?"}

John Bel Edwards said at a press conference Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"We're just getting started,\" he said.\n\nThe storm came ashore as a Category 4 storm in Port Fourchon on the Louisiana coast just before noon Sunday. With 150 mile-per-hour winds, it is one of the strongest hurricanes to make landfall in Louisiana since the middle of the 19th century.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the coming days and weeks are going to be extremely difficult for our state, and many, many people are going to be tested in ways that we can only imagine today,\" Edwards said. \"But I can also tell you that, as a state, we've never been more prepared.\"\n\nIda arrived on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina — which destroyed much of New Orleans – and two days after the first anniversary of Hurricane Laura, which devastated Lake Charles in the southwestern region of the state.\n\nEdwards said southeastern Louisiana residents who stayed for Hurricane Ida need to be prepared to \"shelter in place\" for 72 hours after the storm has passed. Search and rescue crews won't be able to start their work until Monday morning, he said.\n\n\"We will be ready at first light tomorrow morning to go out in those areas that we know already have received the most damaging impacts of the storm,\" Edwards said.\n\nLouisiana's entire National Guard — nearly 5,000 people — have been called up to service. The state fire marshal, law enforcement and Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries agents will also be involved in search and rescue missions — and there's an additional 900 people on loan from 16 other states available to help, Edwards said.\n\nBy Sunday evening, Ida had already hit Louisiana's coastal towns like Houma, which is home to a large segment of the state's commercial fishing operations and the nexus of the offshore oil and gas industry. Ida also walloped Grand Isle, a popular vacation spot, though Edwards said almost the entire population of that barrier island had been evacuated before the storm.\n\nFrom Sunday evening to Monday morning, Ida is expected to creep its way up into the most populous areas of Louisiana — hitting New Orleans, Baton Rouge and the northshore of Lake Pontchartrain hard. Communities will not not only face the strongest winds they have seen in decades, but may also be inundated with flooding for much of the rest of the week, according to local weather reports.\n\nMany coastal parishes put mandatory evacuations in place Friday. Notably, New Orleans did not. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said the storm was moving too quickly by Friday evening to safely make that call, but thousands of residents fled the city voluntarily, resulting in hours-long traffic jams on interstates going to Texas and Florida on Saturday.\n\nLouisiana is trying to avoid some of the problems it saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Department of Public Safety and Corrections has agreed to house 2,500 jail detainees and prisoners from Acadia, Plaquemines, St. Mary, Orleans, St. Bernard, Vermillion and Terrebonne parishes. After Hurricane Katrina, people in jails struggled to get access to food and water.\n\nEdwards also insisted Sunday that the state is \"more prepared than it ever has been\" for a hurricane of Ida's magnitude. After Hurricane Katrina, the federal government spent billions of dollars developing a new protection system consisting of levees and floodgates around New Orleans and its surrounding parishes. Though Louisiana has been threatened with other storms in recent years, Hurricane Ida is the first time the state intends to make use of the full protection system.\n\n\"Will [New Orleans storm protection system] be tested? Yes. But it was built for this moment,\" Edwards said.\n\nThe governor said about 1,400 people were being housed in public shelters across the state Sunday afternoon, but expected that number to grow. Power companies are warning Louisiana residents that they could be without electricity — and air conditioning — for several days.\n\nThe governor expects that more people will find their homes uninhabitable after the hurricane passes. The state has enough capacity to house approximately 10,300 people now and more public shelters will be opened."}

The disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico that would morph into Hurricane Ida was days away from landfall.\n\n\"We were supposed to bring a barge down here to Port Fourchon to get loaded and get back out,\" Dryden said during a phone interview Tuesday. \"We were trying to get loaded and tried to get back out before the storm hit. Well, we got down here and it was raining and there were thunderstorms. We just didn't have enough time to get out.\"\n\nIda strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it churned toward Louisiana's southeast coast. The storm swept ashore near Port Fourchon about 11:55 a.m. Sunday packing 150-mph winds and a storm surge forecasters and local officials estimated was at least 12 feet.\n\nThere was nothing the Brittany Lynn's three-member crew could do except batten down the hatches and hope for the best, said Dryden, who is from Deridder.\n\n\"I definitely didn't want to be down here because I knew this area was close to getting a direct hit,\" he said. \"You couldn't see the debris flying through the air. We were tied up against a dock. There was a trailer of offices out there about 600 feet from us and you couldn't see it during the storm. When the winds died down you could see right through that trailer. The walls were gone.\"\n\nAs the boat rocked against Ida's ferocious 150 mph winds, the unthinkable happened, Dryden said.\n\n\"At one point there when the eye was just about to come over us, there were some boats that got loose and hit our barges that we were tied to, which broke us loose,\" he said. \"I was looking at my chart system and could tell we were starting to move. I said to the head captain, 'We broke loose, man. Those boats behind us done hit us and broke us loose.' \"\n\nIt was the only time during the harrowing ordeal that Dryden said he was scared.\n\n\"The only time I got really worried was when we broke loose,\" he said. \"When it broke our barges loose and we went across the canal, I couldn't tell which way we were going. All I could tell is that we were moving. I didn't know if we were going to have to abandon the ship or what was fixing to happen.\"\n\nIda's winds tapered about 30 minutes later, which gave the crew just enough time to move the barges back to the dock and get secured, Dryden said.\n\nBut Ida wasn't through with Port Fourchon just yet.\n\n\"No sooner than we got them secured, the back side of the eye came and we were in for another ride for about three or four hours,\" Dryden said. \"The back end was way worse. I was concerned, but at least it was blowing us to the dock and not away from it. It was wild.\"\n\nThere were about 40 boats carrying around 300 people combined at Port Fourchon when Ida made landfall Sunday, said Chett Chiasson, executive director of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission.\n\nThe port, at the southern tip of Lafourche Parish, serves as the service hub for almost all of the Gulf of Mexico oilfield.\n\n\"There were no injuries for our employees and family and to my knowledge no major injuries in this area,\" Chiasson said. \"There will not be movement in the port until we can assess the navigable waterways for obstructions.\"\n\nAs for Dryden, he said he will never ride out a storm on a boat again."}

She counts herself as lucky that she received about $17,000 from FEMA — much more than most of her Queens neighbors.\n\nBhagwandin, 51, had several contractors come out to assess the damage, and none wanted to touch the severely compromised foundation. Instead, they advised her to fill the basement and lift the house, a project that would cost an estimated $300,000.\n\nAnd that's on top of what she's already spent on repairs after repeated floods. She keeps a trove of manilla folders filled with photos of damage.\n\n\"I don't understand what kind of life this is in New York City,\" Bhagwandin said. \"Do you know how scary it is? I run out of the house every time it rains. I cannot take a summer vacation because I have to stay and watch my house.\"\n\nBhagwandin is one of many New Yorkers whose homes were damaged in the deadly Sept. 1 storm and who say they are still waiting for adequate assistance, more than three months later.\n\nRenters and homeowners are facing different obstacles — and seek different types of relief. Bhagwandin wants the city to buy her home. Tenants, meanwhile, need their apartments renovated or a whole new place to live.\n\nYet storm victims on all sides say their ongoing shared experiences, including temporary displacement and long-term uncertainty, underscore a housing crisis exacerbated by climate change.\n\nAnd despite recently extended state and federal timelines to apply for financial assistance, storm-slammed New Yorkers charge they've been largely forsaken.\n\n\"This is what's very painful here, that we have to be chasing all these politicians to get this work done,\" Bhagwandin said. \"There's no urgency.\"\n\n'We Live Day to Day'\n\nFor renters, securing new housing in New York's expensive market has been particularly difficult — especially in the wake of the storm, which killed 13 people, 11 of whom died in basement apartments.\n\nHeidi Pashko and her husband have been living with their adult son and his two young children on Long Island ever since Ida hit. Their rented Forest Hills one-bedroom apartment — their home for more than 40 years — is still a wreck.\n\nPashko, 67, was used to paying \"fabulous rent\" for her spacious first-floor unit with high ceilings, but her hunt for furnished studios and one-bedrooms in Queens and Long Island has been discouraging. Nothing is as good as what she'd had — and everything costs at least double what she'd been paying.\n\n\"I feel bad sleeping on their couch, but I have nowhere to go,\" Pashko said. \"As long as my son will have me, I'm staying here. I'm with the grandkids every day, taking care of them.\"\n\nPashko's retirement from her job as a public school aide began the day of the storm, so money is tight. Before Ida, she'd just renovated the apartment and purchased a new stove and refrigerator.\n\n\"It's hard,\" she added. \"I don't know what my plans are. I don't know what I'm doing. We live from day to day.\"\n\nPashko said she and her husband received \"a couple thousand dollars\" from FEMA and are in the process of appealing to get more.\n\n'Emotionally, You're Done'\n\nAs of Dec. 3, more than 88,700 people in New York City had applied for assistance from FEMA, with $163.7 million approved, according to Kevin Sur, an agency spokesperson. Sur declined to specify how many applicants were approved or denied funds.\n\nData FEMA provided to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Queens, The Bronx) and Jamaal Bowman (D-The Bronx, Westchester) showed that about half of applicants in Queens and the Bronx received funding.\n\nThe two politicians sent a letter to FEMA late last month asking the agency to provide sufficient funds to help storm-battered New Yorkers \"rebuild their homes and restore damaged property.\"\n\nApplicants can appeal FEMA's decision within 60 days.\n\nThat's what Tina Jimenez, 62 of East Elmhurst is doing. But it's not easy.\n\n\"Emotionally, you're done,\" Jimenez said. \"This added burden — you have to explain yourself and explain yourself and everybody's giving you a different answer.\""}

But Ida also encountered natural barriers like wetlands that act as a \"speed bump\" and blunt the impact of storms.\n\nAlthough natural defenses have their limits — especially with major events like Ida — experts say they can play an important part in protecting communities and the environment when storms strike.\n\n\"There is always a benefit by having these wetlands between you and the storm,\" said Gerald Galloway, a recently retired University of Maryland engineering professor who previously worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nSince the devastation of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, a key part of Louisiana's efforts to bulk up its storm defenses has been restoring the wetlands and barrier islands the state has been losing for decades along its coast.\n\nHOW DOES NATURAL TERRAIN PROTECT AGAINST STORMS?\n\nWetlands and other natural terrain can act as buffers for wind and water, giving storm surges more to overcome before they reach people and buildings.\n\n\"They help with storm protection because they are dissipating energy,\" said Hugh J. Roberts, chief operating officer at the Water Institute of the Gulf, an environmental research group.\n\nRoberts compared it to a cyclist riding over rocky debris. Sparse wetlands are like riding over a few pebbles, he said — hardly noticeable. But robust wetlands with elevated terrains are like trying to ride over a long, bumpier stretch of gravel.\n\nThe Water Institute has received funding from the Walton Family Foundation, which also supports The Associated Press' coverage of water and environmental policy.\n\nWHAT ABOUT BIG STORMS LIKE IDA?\n\nWetlands are generally more effective at lessening the impact of small to moderate surges of ocean water, said Ed Link, a researcher at the University of Maryland who previously directed an analysis of New Orleans' storm protections after Katrina.\n\nWith bigger storms like Ida, the effect may be more muted. Once wetlands are full of water, they lose their ability to slow down waves and the storm can travel over them, Link said."}

For almost 10 years, he told his family he wanted to cut it down, but he couldn't afford the expense of a tree-cutting service.\n\nOn Sunday night, as Hurricane Ida started shredding its way through southeast Louisiana, the tree crashed down in his front yard and killed him. It crushed the top of a white truck that Duplessis had just stepped out of on the passenger side, and a broken branch severed an artery in his leg.\n\nThe storm had already knocked out power in the neighborhood. He never saw the tree falling in the total darkness and cascading rain surrounding him.\n\nDuplessis' nephew, Caleb Marcantel, was in the driver's seat and pinned in the truck by the tree. Despite all odds, he climbed out with only a wound to his hand. He ran across the street to get his sister-in-law, a nurse, to help his uncle who was now bleeding out on the driveway.\n\nCrystal Marcantel rushed outside with Caleb to put pressure on the leg while sustained winds of 115 miles per hour roared around them. She tried to stop the bleeding, but she knew the situation was dire. While comforted by his family members, Dennis Duplessis recited the Lord's Prayer, and then uttered his final words – a message to his wife of more than 40 years.\n\n\"Tell Hope that I love her,\" he said, according to his daughter. He passed away within minutes and before paramedics could arrive.\n\nDuplessis, 60, was the first confirmed fatality in the devastating storm system that's now killed dozens and left millions without power, water, or access to essential needs in the scorching summer heat. The storm left a path of destruction across a large portion of the United States, from Louisiana to New York.\n\n\"He always said he'd give his last breath for (his wife), and he wanted to go before her,\" said Duplessis' daughter, Chasity Fatherree. \"He was out here trying to hook up the generator for her. And he went before her.\"\n\nFour days after his death, Fatherree stood in her father's driveway while volunteers from nearby churches sawed away at the nearly giant tree that's still laying in their front yard, a reminder of the tragic accident that unfolded earlier this week.\n\n\"He hated that tree,\" Fatherree said.\n\n\"The what-ifs and the timing is all I can think about,\" she added. \"I close my eyes and I just see the tree hitting him. It's just, it's horrible – the tree that he hated.\"\n\nNo one expected the storm to carry so much strength as it moved inland from the gulf. By the time the storm hit Gonzales, which is about 67 miles northwest of New Orleans, it was still a Category 3 hurricane, after initially making landfall as a Category 4.\n\nWhile Gonzales and the larger Baton Rouge area were spared the same devastation that struck other parts of Southeast Louisiana, it still tore down power lines and trees. In Ascension Parish, which includes Gonzales, nearly 26,000 customers were still without power as of Friday night, five days after the hurricane.\n\nHistoric church built by freed slaves is badly damaged\n\nStorms like Ida change lives. The damage can't be measured solely by the physical destruction; storms also take symbols of the past.\n\nNearly 40 miles southeast of Gonzales, the Whitney Plantation in Edgard has become a historic museum that focuses on the experience of enslaved Africans. Joy Banner is a descendent of enslaved people and now works as the museum's communications director.\n\nShe lives in the area and sought shelter Sunday night in the plantation's mansion, which was built in 1791 by her ancestors. When the sun rose the next morning, she walked out to find the big house and the slave's former cabins were largely spared, but the historic church built by freed slaves after Emancipation was badly damaged. Some structures, like a century-old barn, were completely flattened. The beautiful white picket fence around the property was barely standing.\n\nJoy Banner, the communications director at Whitney Plantation and a descendent of enslaved Africans, shows some of the damage to a church that was built by freed slaves on the plantation, which is now a museum. Ashley Killough/CNN\n\n\"It was such a sinking feeling in my heart,\" she said. \"Just walking around and seeing some of our buildings did collapse, seeing some of the trees and debris all over the site...There was lots of tears. It was such a surreal experience.\"\n\nBanner said she believes much of the damage is restorable, but it could take months before they can reopen."}

The 1969 orange Dodge Charger has been an increasingly controversial pop culture icon over the years, given it was named after Civil War general Robert E. Lee and was decorated with a confederate flag on its roof. In 2015, TV Land removed reruns of the show and Warner Bros. halted production of General Lee toy cars amid a movement to remove Confederate symbols across the South.\n\nSchneider defended the vehicle in a Hollywood Reporter interview last year. \"I have never had an African American come up to me and have any problem with it whatsoever,\" Schneider said. \"Dukes of Hazzard was a unifying force. Mom, grandma, everyone wanted to watch it together. But who benefits from division? The Dukes of Hazzard has been shot down, I believe unfairly. We haven't missed a generation yet, but we may miss this next one.\"\n\nSchneider noted he was returning from Tennessee, where he was working on hurricane relief efforts. \"I'll get a real look at the damage to mom's house in the morning and then head back to TN to continue flood relief,\" he added on Twitter on Tuesday. \"My request is that if you know somebody that's going through something like this, then you help them — go out and help them...\"\n\nThe actor requested help for the damages by directing fans to his studio's website.

The man's wife said she heard a splash after he went outside his home one day after Hurricane Ida blew through the area and walked out to see him being attacked by the alligator, which had already ripped one of his arms off. The woman then took off in a boat to find an area with a cell signal to dial 911, but Satterlee had disappeared when she got back to the house—along with the alligator. Local sheriff's deputies found the enormous alligator near Satterlee's home two weeks after the attack, at which point they captured and killed it, finding human remains inside. Preston said he will likely rule the death was an accident.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThere are more than 2 million alligators living in the wild in Louisiana, but the reptiles rarely attack humans. Fatal attacks are essentially unheard of, but at least one other death in the state's history is believed to be the result of an alligator attack. A French blacksmith named Jacques du Bois was found naked and dead on a river bank in 1774, with a coroner ruling he had been attacked by an alligator while bathing in the river, according to the St. Charles Herald Guide.\n\nBig Number\n\n1. That's how many people are killed annually by alligators in the U.S. on average, according to the University of Florida."}

By Friday night, more than 1,900 people had expressed interest in joining.\n\nGrant, 41, estimates the number of protesters Saturday afternoon was closer to 150, which dwindled to 100 as inclement weather dampened enthusiasm. Those who showed up did so in all sorts of creative costumes, including a fly, Oscar the Grouch (trash can included) and Grant's favorite, Marie Antoinette, who held a sign that said: \"Let them eat trash.\"\n\nBeing witty and satirical in the aftermath of a disaster, said Grant, is \"a coping mechanism.\"\n\n\"When I called City Hall to apply for a permit, I was asked, 'Is it a protest or a parade? Those are two different categories,'\" Grant recalled. \"I think it's both. Everyone there was upset to a certain degree, and we're using the opportunity to both vent and make a point.\"\n\nOnly two bags of trash were placed in front of City Hall's doors Saturday. But as Grant sat on his stoop Monday afternoon, garbage still hadn't been hauled away.\n\n\"When I turn and look 360 degrees, all I see is trash everywhere,\" he said. \"It's absolutely revolting.

The situation stinks.\"\n\nCantrell said it's a workforce problem: Before Ida hit, the sanitation department was already strapped for employees due to a nationwide shortage. Ida made conditions considerably worse. According to other media outlets and an announcement from Cantrell, the city is now looking for help from outside contractors.\n\nGrant, who manages a live music venue in the French Quarter, isn't impressed.

However, that amount is sure to rise as it does not include classroom supplies and building systems that need to be replaced, structural repairs that must be made, and the replacement of three gymnasium floors that buckled due to flooding, officials said.\n\nThe Sept. 1 tropical storm forced some school districts surrounding Newark, including those in South Orange-Maplewood and Elizabeth, to plan for a delayed start of the school year. However, Newark, which is the state's largest district, managed to open as scheduled this Tuesday despite the damage.\n\nOfficials attributed that feat to the hard work of the district's maintenance crews, custodians, and other employees, some of whom worked around the clock after the storm struck.\n\n\"They put the district's needs above their own and those of their families and even their own homes,\" school board President Dawn Haynes said in a statement. \"They did not want to let anyone down, especially the children, and they did not.\"\n\nNew Jersey remains under a state of emergency following the severe flooding and wind damage caused by Tropical Storm Ida and several tornadoes that tore through the state, which President Joe Biden visited this week during a tour of Ida's destruction. Newark saw a record amount of rainfall that caused flash flooding, forced Newark Liberty International Airport to halt flights, and stranded hundreds of Newark residents who had to be rescued by firefighters and police.\n\nThe damage also battered buildings belonging to Newark Public Schools, which operates 65 schools in dozens of campuses across the city. Some 33 district buildings were flooded, causing water damage in school basements, libraries, gymnasiums, and classrooms, according to information the district released Friday. A district data system stopped working, and a fallen tree blocked a school entrance.\n\nIn response, the district bought and rented equipment to remove water and try to prevent mold and mildew from forming, the press release said. Every school required \"additional attention\" after the storm in order to open successfully this week, the release added.\n\n\"Just like other school districts, we should not have been able to open,\" the press release said, \"but we did. We opened on day one because of our incredible staff.\"\n\nChalkbeat asked the district last week which schools were damaged by the storm, but that information has not been shared.

The attacks killed at least 60 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, Afghan and U.S. officials said.\n\nThe U.S. general overseeing the evacuation said the attacks would not stop the United States from evacuating Americans and others, and flights out were continuing. Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said there was a large amount of security at the airport, and alternate routes were being used to get evacuees in. About 5,000 people were awaiting flights on the airfield, McKenzie said.\n\nThe blasts came hours after Western officials warned of a major attack, urging people to leave the airport. But that advice went largely unheeded by Afghans desperate to escape the country in the last few days of an American-led evacuation before the U.S. officially ends its 20-year presence on Aug. 31.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the killings on its Amaq news channel. The IS affiliate in Afghanistan is far more radical than the Taliban, who recently took control of the country in a lightning blitz. The Taliban were not believed to have been involved in the attacks and condemned the blasts.\n\nIn an emotional speech from the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden said the latest bloodshed would not drive the U.S. out of Afghanistan earlier than scheduled, and that he had instructed the U.S. military to develop plans to strike IS.\n\n\"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,\" Biden said.\n\nU.S. officials initially said 11 Marines and one Navy medic were among those who died. Another service member died hours later. Eighteen service members were wounded and officials warned the toll could grow. More than 140 Afghans were wounded, an Afghan official said.\n\nOne of the bombers struck people standing knee-deep in a wastewater canal under the sweltering sun, throwing bodies into the fetid water. Those who moments earlier had hoped to get on flights out could be seen carrying the wounded to ambulances in a daze, their own clothes darkened with blood.\n\nEmergency, an Italian charity that operates hospitals in Afghanistan, said it had received at least 60 patients wounded in the airport attack, in addition to 10 who were dead when they arrived.\n\n\"Surgeons will be working into the night,\" said Marco Puntin, the charity's manager in Afghanistan. The wounded overflowed the triage zone into the physiotherapy area and more beds were being added, he said.\n\nThe Afghan official who confirmed the overall Afghan toll spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby said one explosion was near an airport entrance and another was a short distance away by a hotel. McKenzie said clearly some failure at the airport allowed a suicide bomber to get so close to the gate.\n\nHe said the Taliban has been screening people outside the gates, though there was no indication that the Taliban deliberately allowed Thursday's attacks to happen. He said the U.S. has asked Taliban commanders to tighten security around the airport's perimeter.\n\nAdam Khan was waiting nearby when he saw the first explosion outside what's known as the Abbey gate.

And they were part of, simply, what I call the 'backbone of America.'

The group provided no evidence to support the claim but US officials have said it was likely behind the atrocity.\n\nIt was ISIS-K's most globally consequential action to date and drew a promise of retribution from US President Joe Biden.\n\nBut the group, known in full as ISIS-Khorasan, has been responsible for thousands of deaths since its 2015 formation.\n\nIts members operate in central Asia, and the group's name comes from its terminology for the area that includes Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2018 it was ranked the world's fourth deadliest terror group, claiming more than 1,000 lives, mostly in Afghanistan, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, which monitors global terrorism annually.\n\nSince then the group's growth has been limited and its militants have fought the Taliban. But they have capitalized on uncertainty in Afghanistan in recent months to launch brutal attacks, and the impending withdrawal of troops by the United States threatens to give them a window in which to regain strength.\n\nHow was ISIS-K formed?\n\nThe group is a branch of ISIS, the terror group that first emerged in Syria and Iraq and, at its peak, controlled a huge stretch of territory stretching from western Syria to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. The original group had its self-declared caliphate ended by US-backed forces in recent years.\n\nBut the connection between ISIS-K and its apparent parent group is not entirely clear; the affiliates share an ideology and tactics, but the depth of their relationship with regards to organization and command and control has never been entirely established.\n\nUS intelligence officials previously told CNN that the ISIS-K membership includes \"a small number of veteran jihadists from Syria and other foreign terrorist fighters,\" saying that the US had identified 10 to 15 of their top operatives in Afghanistan.\n\nIts earliest members included Pakistani militants who emerged in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province around a decade ago, many of whom had fled Pakistan and defected from other terror groups, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nCounter-terrorism analysts estimate its strength now at around 1,500-2,000, but that number may soon grow. Some captured ISIS-K fighters were being held in prisons near Kabul, which the Taliban overran as their offensive accelerated.\n\nWhat do they want?\n\nKey figures involved in the formation of ISIS-K included Taliban defectors – such as former Taliban member Abdul Rauf Aliza, who was briefly held at Guantanamo Bay and was killed in a US drone strike in 2015 after joining ISIS.\n\nBut the group has a mutual hatred of the Taliban, and attracts those with views even more radical than the Taliban.\n\nUnlike the militant group that has seized power in Afghanistan, ISIS and its affiliates have little interest in political governance.\n\n\"ISIS believes that only God can rule. And even though the Taliban is attempting to establish an Islamic emirate, that's not enough for ISIS,\" Colin Clarke, author of \"After the Caliphate: The Islamic State and the Future of the Terrorist Diaspora,\" told CNN before the Kabul airport attacks took place.\n\nIn any place they control, Clarke said, ISIS-K \"are going to implement extremely harsh Sharia law.

It was the deadliest day for the U.S. military since August 6, 2011, when insurgents shot down a transport helicopter, killing 30 Americans and eight Afghans.\n\nIn an interview on The Ana Rosa program, which was published on Monday, Bilal Karimi, spokesman for the Taliban military leadership, said: \"We can control terrorism, the attack at the Kabul airport was the fault of the United States, which made an appeal saying that they were going to take everyone out of Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"They had been outside the airport for many days, I am very sorry but it happened... The US evacuation plan has been very bad, all countries are calmer and there have been no more attacks,\" Karimi told the Spanish journalists.\n\nIn the interview, the spokesperson promised that the Taliban would not harm Spanish nationals that remain in the country.\n\n\"The Islamic State [Emirate] is not going to harm them, what we want is for those who have knowledge to work for the prosperity of their country, so that Afghanistan will rise up and be an advanced country.\"\n\n\"If someone wants to leave the country abroad, when the situation is more normalized, when the Kabul airport is already open, they can always leave with a passport and visa, do it legally and as in the rest of the world.\"\n\nKarimi added: \"They [foreign nationals] are all forgiven, we are not going to hurt, all of them can freely go out through their city, lead a normal life, they do not have to remain in hiding.\"\n\nDespite the Taliban's history of restricting rights of women, the military spokesperson attempted to assure the journalists: \"From the Islamic Emirate we say that it is a man or a woman, it does not matter. They have the same rights to study and advance, no problem. Women can work anywhere, also those who have positions in the government, normally.\"\n\nBut he said that the Taliban wanted women to comply with Islamic law, including in how they dress, so that they do not \"provoke a man.\"\n\n\"As long as they are well and remain in their hijab, they can work in electricity companies, offices, agricultural companies and with normality,\" he said.\n\nBut there has been much opposition to this policy, with groups of women across the country taking to the streets to protest against the Taliban's conservative laws. The militants fired weapons in Kabul on Saturday to break up a protest led by Afghan women demanding equality, just one day after the militant group said there will be \"no issue\" with women's rights."}

The withdrawal occurred as Canada and its military allies braced for imminent attack and to allow for the American-led mission to eventually meet its Aug. 31 deadline for departure. The Associated Press reported that U.S. officials said 11 American marines and one navy medic were killed in the attack by a pair of suicide bombers and gunmen in the crowd clamouring outside Kabul airport. It's not known how many other U.S. personnel were injured. An unknown number of Canadian military personnel stayed behind to assist the American withdrawal, and all were \"safe and accounted for\" after the Thursday bombing, the Canadian Forces said on Twitter. Canada's departure, its fiery aftermath, and the concerns about those left behind laid bare the raw emotional scars of the firmly severed connection in the long-suffering country. There, Canadian blood was spilled alongside its western allies to help the Afghans build a prosperous country after the Taliban was routed in 2001. Its estimated more than 47,000 Afghan civilians, as well as over 66,000 members of the Afghan national military and police also died in the war.\n\n\"I'll just say from our perspective, warfare is always chaotic, and unpredictable. And hindsight is 2020. Based on the information we had at the time, yes, we were surprised by the speed of the of the Taliban takeover of Kabul. And I'm sure there'll be much ink spilt about this,\" said Gen. Wayne Eyre, the acting chief of the defence staff. Eyre said Canadians were among the last to leave, that military personnel are taking the withdrawal personally and many will feel guilty that they had to leave people behind.

Group That Claimed Responsibility for Kabul Airport Attack Is a Rival of the Taliban\n\nLast Thursday, a bombing and shooting outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghan civilians.\n\nThe group that has claimed responsibility is known as the Islamic State Khorasan or ISIS-K, a regional affiliate of the Islamic State and, officials say, a dangerous threat in the region.\n\nOn Monday — one day ahead of a deadline the U.S. had set to leave Afghanistan — the Pentagon announced it had officially withdrawn from the country, ending a 20-year war with a sometimes chaotic evacuation of Americans and Afghan refugees spurred in part, said President Joe Biden, by ISIS-K's planned attacks on U.S. troops and others.\n\nIn a White House speech on Tuesday, Biden lauded the military for completing what he called one of the \"biggest airlifts in history.\"\n\n\"For weeks, they risked their lives to get American citizens [and] Afghans who helped us ... onboard planes and out of the country,\" Biden said, \"and they did it knowing ISIS-K terrorists — sworn enemies of the Taliban — were lurking in the midst of the crowd.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the group.\n\nIt's a branch of Islamic State extremists\n\nThe Islamic State Khorasan — also known by the acronyms ISIS-K, ISKP and ISK — has been recognized by Islamic State leadership, making it an official branch of the religious extremist movement that sought to take over parts of Iraq and Syria some eight years ago before being beat back by U.S.-led forces.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Economics and Peace's Global Terrorism Index — which ranked ISIS-K among the top four deadliest terrorist organizations in the world in 2019 — the group emerged in 2014 and seeks to establish a caliphate (an Islamic government) in what they call Khorasan, a term for a region historically covering parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia.\n\nAccording to West Point's Combatting Terrorism Center, the group was founded by former members of the Pakistani Taliban, the Afghan Taliban and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and includes members from a number of other militant and terror groups.\n\nIt's a rival of the Taliban\n\nAs President Biden noted in his Tuesday remarks, ISIS-K is an enemy of the Taliban despite the two groups fighting the U.S.\n\nWhile the Taliban brutally ruled Afghanistan prior to the U.S. invasion of the country in 2001, ISIS-K is said to be even more extreme in its views of women and ethnic minorities — and its members had splintered from the Taliban over these views.\n\nIn May, the group bombed a girls' school attended by Hazara (a religious and ethnic minority) students, killing more than than 85 Hazara children.\n\nThen, in early June, the Islamic State claimed responsibility after masked gunmen shot dead 10 mine-clearers working in Afghanistan's northern province of Baghlan, specifically targeting Hazara workers.\n\nThe CEO of the company that owned the mine told the BBC in a previous interview that members of the Taliban attempted to help those caught in the crossfire.\n\n\"I think it's important to know that the Taliban have denied responsibility for this, and indeed the local Taliban group came to our aid and scared the assailants off,\" he told the network.\n\nThe Taliban also condemned last week's Kabul airport attack, with a spokesperson for the group saying in a statement: \"Evil circles will strictly be stopped.\"\n\nExperts have said the rivalry means that the Taliban won't likely offer members of ISIS-K safe haven in Afghanistan — at least for now."}

This includes nearly 8,000 Afghans under the UK's relocation scheme for former staff and vulnerable individuals, as well as 4,000 British passport holders.\n\nBut Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said \"not everyone has been able to be evacuated during this process\", including around 800 to 1,100 eligible Afghans\n\nHe said to maximise the number of people evacuated, limits on passenger numbers had been loosened. Some military equipment will be left behind to make extra space.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he hopes for a \"second phase\", during which the Taliban understands \"there has got to be a reasonable approach to people who still want to leave\".\n\nWhat has the US said?\n\nUS President Joe Biden has stood by his decision to leave by 31 August."}

We are concerned about our leadership as they could target them if not controlled them successfully,\" said one of the Taliban intelligence officials.\n\nIslamic State in Khorasan, the name taken from the ancient name for the region that includes modern Afghanistan, first emerged in late 2014 but has declined from its peak around 2018 following a series of heavy losses inflicted by both the Taliban and U.S. forces.\n\nTaliban security forces in Nangarhar said they had killed three members of the movement on Wednesday night and the intelligence officials said the movement still retains the ability to cause trouble through small-scale attacks.\n\n\"Their main structure is broken and they are now divided in small groups to carry out attacks,\" one of them said.\n\nFUNDING DRIED UP\n\nThe Taliban have said repeatedly that they will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacks on other countries. But some Western analysts believe the return of the Islamist group to power has invigorated groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda, which had made Afghanistan their base when the Taliban last ruled the country.\n\n\"In Afghanistan, the return of Taliban is a huge victory for the Islamists,\" said Rohan Gunaratna, professor of security studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. \"They have celebrated the return of the Taliban, so I think that Afghanistan is the new theatre.\"\n\nISIS-K is believed to draw many of its fighters from the ranks of the Taliban or the Pakistani version of the Taliban, known as the TTP, but much of the way it operates remains little understood.\n\nIt has fought the Taliban over smuggling routes and other economic interests but it also supports a global Caliphate under Islamic law, in contrast with the Taliban which insists it has no interest in anywhere outside Afghanistan.\n\nMost analysts, as well as the United Nations peg ISIS-K's strength at under 2,000 fighters, compared to as many as 100,000 at the Taliban's disposal. The ranks of ISIS-K were swollen with prisoners released when Afghanistan's jails were opened by the Taliban as they swept through the country.\n\nAccording to a June report by the UN security council, ISIS-K's financial and logistic ties to its parent organisation in Syria have weakened, though it does retain some channels of communication.\n\n\"Funding support to the Khorasan branch from the core is believed to have effectively dried up,\" the report said."}

I want to speak today to the unfolding situation in Afghanistan: the developments that have taken place in the last week and the steps we're taking to address the rapidly evolving events.\n\nMy national security team and I have been closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and moving quickly to execute the plans we had put in place to respond to every constituency, including — and contingency — including the rapid collapse we're seeing now.\n\nI'll speak more in a moment about the specific steps we're taking, but I want to remind everyone how we got here and what America's interests are in Afghanistan.\n\nWe went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals: get those who attacked us on September 11th, 2001, and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again.\n\nWe did that. We severely degraded al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We never gave up the hunt for Osama bin Laden, and we got him. That was a decade ago.\n\nOur mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building. It was never supposed to be creating a unified, centralized democracy.\n\nOur only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been: preventing a terrorist attack on American homeland.\n\nI've argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorism — not counterinsurgency or nation building. That's why I opposed the surge when it was proposed in 2009 when I was Vice President.\n\nAnd that's why, as President, I am adamant that we focus on the threats we face today in 2021 — not yesterday's threats.\n\nToday, the terrorist threat has metastasized well beyond Afghanistan: al Shabaab in Somalia, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Nusra in Syria, ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia. These threats warrant our attention and our resources.\n\nWe conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we don't have a permanent military presence.\n\nIf necessary, we will do the same in Afghanistan. We've developed counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if needed.\n\nWhen I came into office, I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban. Under his agreement, U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021 — just a little over three months after I took office.\n\nU.S. forces had already drawn down during the Trump administration from roughly 15,500 American forces to 2,500 troops in country, and the Taliban was at its strongest militarily since 2001.\n\nThe choice I had to make, as your President, was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season.\n\nThere would have been no ceasefire after May 1. There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1. There was no status quo of stability without American casualties after May 1.\n\nThere was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan, lurching into the third decade of conflict.\n\nI stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces.\n\nThat's why we were still there. We were clear-eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency.\n\nBut I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated.\n\nSo what's happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight.\n\nIf anything, the developments of the past week reinforced that ending U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision.\n\nAmerican troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves. We spent over a trillion dollars. We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong — incredibly well equipped — a force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies.\n\nWe gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries, provided for the maintenance of their air force — something the Taliban doesn't have. Taliban does not have an air force. We provided close air support.\n\nWe gave them every chance to determine their own future. What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future.\n\nThere's some very brave and capable Afghan special forces units and soldiers, but if Afghanistan is unable to mount any real resistance to the Taliban now, there is no chance that 1 year — 1 more year, 5 more years, or 20 more years of U.S. military boots on the ground would've made any difference.\n\nAnd here's what I believe to my core: It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistan's own armed forces would not. If the political leaders of Afghanistan were unable to come together for the good of their people, unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chips were down, they would never have done so while U.S. troops remained in Afghanistan bearing the brunt of the fighting for them.\n\nAnd our true strategic competitors — China and Russia — would love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitely.\n\nWhen I hosted President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July, we had very frank conversations. We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the U.S. military departed, to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people. We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically.\n\nThey failed to do any of that.\n\nI also urged them to engage in diplomacy, to seek a political settlement with the Taliban. This advice was flatly refused. Mr. Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight, but obviously he was wrong.\n\nSo I'm left again to ask of those who argue that we should stay: How many more generations of America's daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghans — Afghanistan's civil war when Afghan troops will not? How many more lives — American lives — is it worth? How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National Cemetery?\n\nI'm clear on my answer: I will not repeat the mistakes we've made in the past — the mistake of staying and fighting indefinitely in a conflict that is not in the national interest of the United States, of doubling down on a civil war in a foreign country, of attempting to remake a country through the endless military deployments of U.S. forces.\n\nThose are the mistakes we cannot continue to repeat, because we have significant vital interests in the world that we cannot afford to ignore.\n\nI also want to acknowledge how painful this is to so many of us. The scenes we're seeing in Afghanistan, they're gut-wrenching, particularly for our veterans, our diplomats, humanitarian workers, for anyone who has spent time on the ground working to support the Afghan people."}

Security around the airport was crumbling, and the future of my Afghan colleagues was increasingly uncertain. They had received Taliban threats in the past, and both have young families for whom they fear the most.\n\nReaching the airport would be the most difficult part, and it was something we decided we had to do together.\n\nWe hadn't seen each other since the Taliban took over the capital, and the reunion — after so much anxiety, fear and change — was emotional. On a dusty gravel road lined by concrete barriers outside the airport, we embraced. It was one of the first moments of joy and relief in a long time. Everyone was in tears.\n\nNext, we had to make a run for the military side of the airport, a part of the city quickly becoming the most dangerous.\n\nThe night before, Taliban fighters had stormed a crowd waiting outside the terminal, beating men, women and children attempting to flee the country. By morning, the militants had set up checkpoints and deployed dozens of fighters to block roads leading to the airport. One of those checkpoints was a just a few hundred yards from the compound where I was staying.\n\n\"Why do you want to leave the country? What are you, traitors?\" the militants screamed at a crowd forming beside one of the main airport entrances, known as Abbey gate, in a scene witnessed by Washington Post reporter Aziz Tassal. One fighter slapped a man who approached the barrier, and another was struck with the butt of a rifle.\n\nWashington Post editors had arranged seats for staffers and their families on a charter flight set to leave within hours, but getting to the flight would require entering through that same gate. Our chances of making it through the gate safely and then onto the plane were slim. But the crowds at the airport were growing by the day, and the Taliban was becoming more brutal. We decided it was worth a shot.\n\nWe were traveling with eight small children, the youngest not even a year old, and were most concerned about their safety. Two nights before, Tassal and his young daughter were beaten by Taliban fighters as they waited on the civilian side of the airport for a flight that never materialized. That experience, my colleagues later said, only hardened their resolve to escape, but it left their families terrified of returning to the scene.\n\n\"I will never forget how they beat my small daughter,\" Tassal said, showing me the dark blue bruise on her side. \"They will never change. My country is gone forever.\"\n\nIt was possible that we could experience a repeat of that night. But I felt that if I was with the group — the only Post employee left in the country with an American passport — we would be more likely to get inside the base. And if we rented armored cars, we would be partially protected from an attack if the road was breached."}

Anti-Taliban fighters claimed to have seized three mountainous districts, and a prominent militia commander in the only province not yet under Taliban control pledged to fight back if attacked.\n\nThe British military on Sunday acknowledged at least seven deaths at the airport. Others may have been trampled, suffocated or suffered heart attacks as Taliban fighters fired into the air to try to drive back the crowds. Soldiers covered several corpses in white clothing. Other troops stood on concrete barriers, trying to calm the crowd.\n\nKabul's airport, now one of the only routes out of the country, has seen days of chaos since the Taliban entered the capital on Aug. 15. Thousands poured onto the tarmac last week, and several Afghans plunged to their deaths after clinging to a U.S. military cargo plane as it took off, some of the seven killed on Aug. 16.\n\nThe Taliban have pledged amnesty to those who worked with the U.S., NATO and the toppled Afghan government, but many Afghans still fear revenge attacks. There have been reports in recent days of the Taliban hunting down their former enemies. It's unclear if Taliban leaders are saying one thing and doing another, or if fighters are taking matters into their own hands.\n\nOutside the airport on Saturday, Western troops in full combat gear tried to control crowds big enough to be seen in satellite photos. They carried away some who were sweating and pale. With temperatures reaching 34 degrees Celsius (93 F), the soldiers sprayed water from a hose on those gathered and gave out bottled water.\n\n\"The situation at Kabul airport remains extremely challenging and unpredictable,\" a NATO official said on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations.

That's in addition to about 3,900 people airlifted on non-U.S. military flights over the past 24 hours.

The voluntary program, born in the wake of the Berlin airlift, adds to the military's capabilities during crises.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has vowed to bring home all Americans from Afghanistan and to evacuate Afghans who aided the U.S. war effort. U.S. military helicopters have been used to collect 169 Americans from outside the airport. Tens of thousands of Americans and others are still hoping to fly out.\n\nThere also have been concerns about a potential attack on the airport by a local Islamic State affiliate. U.S. military planes have been executing corkscrew landings, and other aircraft have fired flares upon takeoff, measures used to prevent missile attacks.\n\nThe Taliban blame the chaotic evacuation on the U.S. military, saying there's no need for Afghans to fear them, even though their fighters shoot into the air and beat people with batons as they try to control the crowds outside the airport.\n\n\"All Afghanistan is secure, but the airport, which is managed by the Americans, has anarchy,\" Amir Khan Motaqi, a senior Taliban official, said Sunday. The U.S. \"should not embarrass itself to the world and should not give this mentality to our people that (the Taliban) are a kind of enemy.\""}

Only 11km (seven miles) from Mazar, the district is also home to the 209th Shaheen Corps, a 30,000-strong force meant to protect 114 districts across 10 provinces.\n\nAlthough the armed group's attack failed, it still caused major alarm for residents of one of Afghanistan's economic and cultural hubs.\n\nAbdul Wahab was on a business trip from Kabul when the news broke. He was immediately told to leave his well-guarded $77 a night hotel and stay in the homes of friends.\n\n\"The rich and powerful go there, of course, it will be targeted,\" his friends urged.\n\nHe spent last Tuesday night with his friends and then realised he had to get home to Kabul, in case the airport closed. Before its fall, the airport in the Western city of Herat was closed for several days as fighting reached the road leading to it.\n\nBy the following morning, thousands of others had the same idea. Not only did one-way ticket prices double to $150, but there were no tickets for several days. Luckily, Wahab had friends at a travel agency and was able to secure himself a ticket.\n\nBefore he could head to the airport though, he ran into another hurdle, finding cash to pay for the flight.\n\n\"The ATMs were all out of money, the banks were full of hundreds of people lining up trying to take out as much money as they could,\" Wahab said after returning to Kabul. Again, he had to turn to friends to borrow the money for the ticket until he could reach the capital.\n\nWhen he arrived at Maulana Jalaluddin Balkhi International Airport, though, it became evident that having a ticket was not a guarantee one could board a plane. He, and others who were trying to fly out at the height of the panic, described an overcrowded airport, teeming with clusters of hundreds of people at each step from the entrance to the security checks to the check-in desks and the departures terminal.\n\nPeople rush to the airport\n\nAva was at the airport with her mother, father and brother. The crowds were so large and the waiting halls so congested, the 21-year-old started to have panic attacks.\n\n\"It was hot and crowded. Everyone was shuffling around, I couldn't breathe,\" she said from her sister's home in Kabul. For Ava, her small frame and youth made it even more difficult to manoeuvre around the throngs of people.\n\nBoth Wahab and Ava recalled crowds of angry people trying to muscle through lines and concession stands.\n\n\"There was nothing left in the food stalls, people were there for hours trying to get food or water.\"\n\nFor Wahab, that meant waiting eight hours as his 4pm flight was changed and delayed until finally they left after midnight. The midnight flight itself was a special accommodation for the fact that there were back-to-back hourly flights, each one just as full as the other."}

The militants knew she was working for a U.S.-funded research program, the letter stated. It was only a matter of time before they killed her.\n\nQaderi immediately thought about leaving Afghanistan, but had no place to go.\n\nNow it was Aug. 15 and the government was collapsing. Taliban fighters were streaming into the capital. Qaderi, a 24-year-old agricultural scientist, raced out of her office and into traffic-choked streets; her normal 10-minute commute by car stretched to three panic-filled hours. When she finally reached the safety of her living room, her parents and siblings were already gathered there.\n\n\"We need to get out,\" Qaderi said.\n\nThe largest airlift evacuation of civilians in American history was about to begin. By the time it was finished, more than 120,000 people had been spirited to safety in a 17-day operation that President Biden deemed \"an extraordinary success.\"\n\nBut it was also a terrifying, bloody crisis that often overwhelmed the capacity of the U.S. military and diplomatic corps. Instead of an orderly exit, a mad rush for the airport left many behind and others dead in a suicide bombing that claimed the lives of 13 U.S. service members and more than 170 Afghans.\n\nIn a matter of days, thousands of families were divided, with no immediate prospect of reunion, and a continents-spanning diaspora was born. Lives, such as Qaderi's, were indelibly altered, their trajectories determined by a rough combination of courage, split-second choices and chance.\n\nAs the United States retreated, thousands of Afghans who had assisted its mission in ways large and small over the preceding 20 years were left feeling abandoned and betrayed. A motley collection of volunteer groups emerged to try to fill the void. Driven by a combination of duty, embarrassment and guilt, these veterans, aid workers and average citizens banded together to save as many people as they could before the U.S. military withdrew.\n\nThe groups relied on cellphones and ad hoc online networks to communicate directly with Afghans, foreign diplomats and frustrated military officials at the airport.

The US plan for those family members wasn't clear and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe rush to the exits marked an unsettling, tragic end to the US presence in Afghanistan as the Taliban retook control nearly 20 years after the US invaded to avenge the terror attacks of September 2001. After an investment of around $2 trillion, some 2,400 American lives lost and thousands more wounded, a nation-building project that spanned Republican and Democratic administrations devolved in just a few days into a complicated and nerve-wracking rescue mission.\n\nIn a Sunday phone briefing, Austin told House lawmakers Sunday that the evacuation was a \"highly dynamic and very risky operation,\" even as he and other senior US officials worked to project a sense of control.\n\n\"This is not Saigon,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" when asked about President Joe Biden's July assertion that under no circumstances would US personnel be airlifted out of Kabul in a replay of the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975.\n\n'Deliberate, orderly'\n\nBlinken said on ABC that instructions to diplomats to destroy documents, US flags or other items that could be used in Taliban propaganda are \"standard operating procedure.\" Echoing Austin's talking points, Blinken added that the evacuation \"is being done in a very deliberate way, orderly way. It's being done with American forces there to do it in a safe way.\"\n\nAt the same time, the US military is considering the possibility of sending additional US forces to Afghanistan, according to a defense official and US official familiar with the ongoing discussions. Both officials caution no decision has been made.\n\nThe defense official said the \"current plan\" is that as long as any US diplomats maintain a presence at the airport, there will be a contingent of US forces there to protect them. But the official acknowledged that if the Taliban are essentially in charge, the \"reality\" of keeping diplomats and troops at the airport may not hold.\n\nGen. Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, arrived in the Persian Gulf region Sunday to directly oversee the situation in Afghanistan, according to the defense official. The official declined to publicly name McKenzie's location, but said the general is not in Afghanistan.\n\nA military team was expected to arrive and set up its own air traffic control system at the airport in Kabul in order to increase the number of evacuation flights out of the airfield.

We left on a plane with empty seats, seated in crew-only seats to ensure that nobody who needed a seat would lose one because of our presence.\"\n\nIn an interview with New York magazine, Moulton insisted they had the \"lightest footprint\" and that they had tried to get official permission, though a congressional committee spokeswoman denied that.\n\nMoulton was at Kabul's airport for about 15 hours, according to New York.\n\n\"I've never seen more people cry, just salty Marines, seasoned State Department veterans just break down in tears, talking about their work, and hugging me, and saying thank you for coming,\" he told New York of what he saw at the airport.\n\nHe had sharp words, too, for President Joe Biden whom he argued had not properly prepared for the evacuations to go along with the withdrawal as the U.S. ended its 20-year war.\n\n\"The thing that everybody needs to understand, even if you completely agree with the Biden administration's decision to withdraw, the way they have handled this has been a total f------ disaster,\" Moulton told New York.\n\nThe White House, in its defense, has said it is committed to helping all U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who want to leave and that the tens of thousands of evacuees so far represent an enormous logistical success.\n\nMeijer and Moulton's trip was slammed by critics as a publicity stunt that could have been disruptive to or a distraction for U.S. forces.\n\nIt also reportedly drew the ire of the Biden administration and Pelosi sent a letter to all House members warning them not to try to go to Afghanistan in the middle of a crisis.\n\nShe said it was \"deadly serious.\"\n\n\"Ensuring the safe and timely evacuation of individuals at risk requires the full focus and attention of the U.S. military and diplomatic teams on the ground in. Afghanistan,\" she wrote. \"Member travel to Afghanistan and the surrounding countries would unnecessarily divert needed resources from the priority mission of safely and expeditiously evacuating American and Afghans at risk from Afghanistan.\"\n\nPolitico reported that Moulton and Meijer paid \"out of pocket\" for their own flights to the United Arab Emirates and then took military flights to and from Kabul.\n\nBoth lawmakers said they oppose Biden's plan to meet an Aug. 31 for the withdrawal of American troops.\n\n\"Washington should be ashamed of the position we put our service members in, but they represent the best in America,\" the pair said in their statement. \"These men and women have been run ragged and are still running strong.\n\nBiden has said that while his administration will continue to support people who want to leave Taliban rule in Afghanistan, the war and its numerous costs must end."}

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The attack killed more than 85 people, mostly students, as class let out Saturday. And at least 147 were wounded in the blast that left the building's outer wall pockmarked by shrapnel, according to the Mohammad Hedayt, the spokesman for Vice President Sarwar Danish.\n\nAfghanistan's Hazara community is frequently targeted by militant groups and was long persecuted by the Taliban. The scale and brutality of Saturday's attack left many Afghans and the international community stunned. Most of the victims were schoolgirls between 13 and 18 years old.\n\nDistrustful of the government and the Taliban, many of Afghanistan's minority groups, particularly the Hazaras, viewed the presence of foreign forces as protective. Following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, many Hazara militias disbanded, trusting that the new order would bring them safety. But now, as U.S. and NATO troops leave amid rising insecurity in the country, many Hazaras describe feeling abandoned, fearing a return to widespread persecution and an increase in attacks like Saturday's bombing.\n\nMukhtar Alizada's younger sister Nekbakht was one of the students killed. Grief-stricken, he described Nekbakht's infectious devotion to her studies. He said the 18-year-old would encourage her siblings to finish their homework and never to miss class.\n\n\"She would tell us we don't have to be poor like our parents; we don't have to be illiterate,\" he said. Nekbakht attended supplementary classes early in the morning before her afternoon classes at Syed Al-Shahda school. Between her studies, she would help her mother and sisters weave carpets at home to supplement her father's income as a day laborer.\n\n\"She had big dreams,\" her mother, Rahila Hydari, said.\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces has brought with it an uptick in violence across Afghanistan. Taliban attacks have hit small outposts around vulnerable government-held towns and cities, but Saturday's was one of the deadliest large-scale bombings targeting civilians in Kabul in months.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack. The Taliban denied any involvement, but Afghan President Ashraf Ghani blamed the militants for the bombing, citing it as proof that they do not want a peaceful settlement to the conflict. Other experts warn that the more instability created in Afghanistan because of the withdrawal of foreign forces, the easier it will be for other militant groups such as the Islamic State to grow in strength.\n\nAn intense diplomatic push was launched earlier this year to reach a peace deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government to avoid the wave of violence now sweeping Afghanistan. The United States pressured the two sides to agree to a deal that included a cease-fire, but it was unsuccessful.\n\nNegotiations are ongoing. \"This is a pivotal moment for the Taliban and Afghan leadership to come together and take responsibility for the future of their country,\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement.\n\n\"We will do all we can to galvanize and support the diplomatic process. That includes negotiations between Afghan leaders and the Taliban and the meaningful participation and inclusion of women, minorities and civil society,\" the statement said.\n\nIn recent years, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks targeting civilians in western Kabul, a neighborhood that is home to many ethnic Hazaras and Shiites, whom the militants view as heretics. A wedding hall bombing, a shooting at a religious gathering and a suicide attack on a gym are just some of the Kabul attacks the Islamic State has claimed.\n\nLast year, gunmen stormed a maternity ward in western Kabul, killing 16 people, including two newborns. That attack also went unclaimed: The Taliban denied responsibility, and the government blamed the militants.\n\nDespite the risks, Nekbakht's parents intend to send their other daughters back to Syed Al-Shahda once it reopens. They cannot afford to move to another neighborhood, and they say education is the only way they can ensure their children will have a better life and perhaps be able to flee Afghanistan one day.\n\n\"I want my children to be teachers or doctors so they can leave this country,\" said Hydari, Nekbakht's mother. Alizada, her brother, conceded, \"now that the U.S. troops are leaving, we fear the situation for Hazaras may get even worse.\"\n\nAlong with Afghan journalists and civil society activists whom the Taliban has threatened, many Hazaras are also attempting to flee.\n\nJawad Zawulistani, a 28-year-old Hazara working for a local human rights NGO, said he refuses to abandon his home country, but many of his friends are leaving or trying to plot an exit."}

Such was their desperation to board a flight out of Kabul that they arrived despite public warnings that the airport was a possible target of the Islamic State.\n\nHere are portraits of a few of them:\n\nALI REZA AHMADI\n\nAli Reza Ahmadi, 36, had fled the Taliban before. When the group first seized Kabul in 1996, he escaped as a child to Iran, where he grew up as a refugee and graduated from high school. He returned to Kabul after the Taliban was toppled from power in 2001. He enrolled at Kabul University, graduating with a degree in journalism in 2013.\n\n\"When we were studying and discussing under trees on Kabul University's campus, we never thought we would be here today,\" said Basir Ebadi, a classmate and friend of Ahmadi. \"Ali Reza was the hopeful one. He imagined an Afghanistan free of violence.\"\n\nAs the Taliban gradually expanded its control over the country, Ahmadi co-founded a news agency, Raha News Agency, and worked as a freelance reporter for local media outlets.\n\nWhen the Taliban entered Kabul on Aug. 15, Ahmadi lost hope. In the first week of the group's rule, Ahmadi wrote in a Facebook post that he had sold off 60 of his books for 50 Afghani (less than $1). He wanted to flee the country.\n\n\"He wanted to save his life,\" said Ebadi, who spoke with Ahmadi a few days ago. \"He encouraged me to pack my bags and flee the country. He said that the Taliban would censor us if they do not kill us now. He said this place is no longer a place for living.\"\n\nAhmadi had no documents for boarding an evacuation flight. Still, he decided on Thursday to try his luck, along with his 33-year-old brother, Mujtaba. They carried their passports and national ID — and the hope that they could somehow enter the airport's gate and hop on to a flight to freedom.\n\nAli's body was unrecognizable after the blast. Mujtaba is still missing.\n\n\"We never thought we would lose [Ali] in this brutal way,\" said Ebadi. \"He had dreams and hopes.\""}

It includes SIV applicants and their families — those Afghans who have worked alongside us, served alongside of us, gone into combat with us, and provided invaluable assistance to us, such as translators and interpreters.\n\nThe United States stands by its commitment that we've made to these people, and it includes other vulnerable Afghans, such as women leaders and journalists.\n\nIn fact, working in close coordination with the management of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal, we have successfully evacuated all 204 of their employees in Afghanistan on U.S. military aircraft earlier this week.\n\nWe have established the flow of flights, and we've increased the number of people we are moving out of the country.\n\nWe paused flights in Kabul a few hours this morning to make sure we could process the arriving evacuees at the transit points, but our commander in Kabul has already given the order for outbound flights to resume.\n\nEven with the pause, we moved out 5,700 evacuees yesterday, and we're working on a variety — to verify that number of the Americans that are still in the country as we work on this because we're not — don't have the exact number of people who are — Americans who are there.

ArrowRight The attack Friday by multiple suicide bombers hit a Shiite mosque in the southern city of Kandahar during midday prayers. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but a similar attack in Kunduz last Friday was claimed by the Islamic State.\n\nTaliban police commander Abdul Ghafar Mohammadi said the blasts killed more than 50 and wounded at least 100, and he said he expected the toll to rise as health workers recovered more bodies.\n\nMany \"dead bodies remain under the ruined mosque,\" Hafiz Abdul Hai Abbas, health director for the province, told The Washington Post earlier in the day.\n\nMany fear recent attacks demonstrate that the Taliban — which took over Afghanistan two months ago — is unable to curb other militant and terrorist groups, especially in urban areas. Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State remain active in Afghanistan, and if they grow in power under Taliban rule, the country could again become a haven for those intent on launching international attacks.\n\nLast Friday's suicide bombing in Kunduz was claimed by the Islamic State's Afghanistan branch. The blast struck a crowded Shiite mosque during Friday prayers, killing nearly 50 worshipers and wounding dozens more. The Sunni extremist Islamic State considers Shiite Muslims to be heretics and often targets their places of worship.\n\nThe Islamic State also claimed responsibility for an attack Thursday that killed a Taliban police chief in the eastern province of Konar, according to local media reports.\n\nThe Taliban's ability to maintain tight security in territory under its control has been a core source of its popularity. Now in control of the entire country, the movement is under immense pressure to extend similar protections nationwide. Taliban leadership condemned Friday's attack as \"a big crime\" and ordered the movement's fighters to arrest those behind it.\n\nEyewitnesses told The Post that they heard multiple explosions from the mosque.\n\n\"First, I heard gunfire and then explosions followed,\" said Abdul Jabar Karimi, 40, who was near the blasts. \"Blood was everywhere.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Murtaza Khaledi, 26, said he saw as many as four suicide bombers — two who detonated their bombs near the mosque's entrance, and two who set off their bombs inside the building.\n\n\"Everyone is shocked. Shiites in Kandahar were never attacked before,\" Khaledi said.\n\nFootage from inside the mosque showed several bloodied bodies on the floor, some covered in sheets, while onlookers wailed. The Taliban said it had sent its elite forces to the site to investigate.\n\nBut Kandahar is not a part of the country that has seen significant Islamic State activity previously. The province is the Taliban's historic heartland, and has great symbolic value and a rural population that has traditionally supported the militants.\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan also condemned the attack on what it said was Kandahar's largest Shiite mosque. The U.N. statement put the number of dead at 30.\n\n\"Those responsible need to be held to account,\" the mission tweeted."}

Small numbers of U.S. special forces and CIA agents soon slip into Afghanistan to help direct the bombing campaign and organise Afghan opposition forces. the Taliban would swiftly be toppled, however, with no major U.S. combat deployment on the ground.\n\nNov. 13, 2001 - U.S.-backed Northern Alliance forces enter Kabul as the Taliban withdraw south. Within a month, Taliban leaders have fled from southern Afghanistan into Pakistan.\n\nDecember 2001 - U.S. forces bomb the Tora Bora cave complex in eastern Afghanistan where bin Laden is reported to be hiding, but he slips over the border into Pakistan, where he disappears.\n\nMay 2, 2003 - U.S. officials declare an end to major combat operations in Afghanistan. Under President George W. Bush, the U.S. focus turns to preparing for the invasion of Iraq, which required a diversion of U.S. troops, equipment, and intelligence collection from Afghanistan. That allows the Taliban to slowly regroup, at first in the south and east.\n\n2006-2008 - With U.S. forces mainly fighting a surge campaign in Iraq, only a much smaller contingent is deployed in Afghanistan. The Taliban launch major advances threatening to recapture swaths of territory, especially in the south. In response, an enlarged NATO mission brings thousands more troops, notably British forces, hundreds of whom are killed in intense battles against the Taliban in Helmand province."}

This evening in Kabul, as you all know, terrorists attacked — that we've been talking about and worried about, that the intelligence community has assessed has [was] undertaken — an attack — by a group known as ISIS-K — took the lives of American service members standing guard at the airport, and wounded several others seriously. They also wounded a number of civilians, and civilians were killed as well.\n\nI've been engaged all day and in constant contact with the military commanders here in Washington, the Pentagon, as well as in Afghanistan and Doha. And my commanders here in Washington and in the field have been on this with great detail, and you've had a chance to speak to some, so far.\n\nThe situation on the ground is still evolving, and I'm constantly being updated.\n\nThese American service members who gave their lives — it's an overused word, but it's totally appropriate — they were heroes. Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.\n\nThey were part of an airlift, an evacuation effort unlike any seen in history, with more than 100,000 American citizens, American partners, Afghans who helped us, and others taken to safety in the last 11 days. Just in the last 12 hours or so, another 7,000 have gotten out.\n\nThey were part of the bravest, most capable, and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth. And they were part of, simply, what I call the \"backbone of America.\" They're the spine of America, the best the country has to offer.\n\nJill and I — our hearts ache, like I'm sure all of you do as well, for all those Afghan families who have lost loved ones, including small children, or been wounded in this vicious attack. And we're outraged as well as heartbroken.\n\nBeing the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and, before that, was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a war — when he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed, like many, many coming home, with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain — who we lost.\n\nWe have some sense, like many of you do, what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today. You get this feeling like you're being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest; there's no way out. My heart aches for you.\n\nBut I know this: We have a continuing obligation, a sacred obligation to all of you — the families of those heroes. That obligation is not temporary; it lasts forever.\n\nThe lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security, in the service of others, in the service of America.\n\nLike their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism of — the fallen this day, they're part of a great and noble company of American heroes.\n\nTo those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.\n\nOver the past few weeks — I know you're — many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it — we've been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K — an arch-enemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were opened — has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others.\n\nThis is why, from the outset, I've repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.\n\nAnd as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed — this is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack. We've known that from the beginning.\n\nAnd as I've been in constant contact with our senior military leaders — and I mean constant, around the clock — and our commanders on the ground and throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. And that's what I've ordered them to do.\n\nWe will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation.\n\nI've also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing.\n\nHere is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get out our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on.\n\nAmerica will not be intimidated.\n\nI have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.\n\nEvery day when I talk to our commanders, I ask them what they need — what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done. As they will tell you, I granted every request."}

Here's what the Taliban takeover means for al-Qaeda and the Islamic State's Afghanistan affiliate.\n\nU.S. officials blamed an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan for twin blasts outside Kabul's airport Thursday, and President Biden pledged to track down leaders of the group who ordered the attack. The explosions left dozens dead or injured, including U.S. military personnel and Afghan civilians. Crowds have thronged the airport since the Taliban took over Kabul on Aug. 15, and U.S. intelligence officials had anticipated the Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) could strike amid the chaos.\n\nThe Islamic State released a statement Thursday claiming responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe ISIS offshoot is a more extreme rival of the Taliban. Experts say the Taliban is likely to try to root out the group. But some warned earlier this month that ISIS-K could benefit from a security vacuum as the Taliban tries to consolidate power.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal was based on the conclusion that terrorist groups would no longer be able to use the country to stage attacks on the United States.\n\n\"We went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals — get those who attacked us on September 11th, 2001, and make sure al-Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again,\" President Biden said in remarks from the White House last week defending the pullout of American forces after the Afghan government's swift collapse. \"We did that.\"\n\nBut the bloody scenes outside the airport Thursday have underscored the ongoing terrorism threat in Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda also continues to operate.\n\nWhile al-Qaeda has been substantially weakened since 2001 — and the Taliban has committed to preventing it from attacking the United States and its allies — al-Qaeda fighters remain in Afghanistan and have hailed the Taliban takeover.\n\nThe Taliban has said it would not allow al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups to launch attacks from the country. But outside observers say the Taliban maintains ties to al-Qaeda.\n\nHere's where the Islamic State and al-Qaeda stand in Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is al-Qaeda's relationship to the Taliban, and how strong is the group?\n\nThe first time the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, from 1996 to 2001, it sheltered al-Qaeda militants who plotted the 9/11 attacks on the United States. The U.S.-led coalition invaded Afghanistan in 2001 with the aim of crushing the extremist group.\n\nAfter two decades of conflict and counterterrorism operations, \"al-Qaeda in Afghanistan is a skeleton of its former self,\" said Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics. He said the group lacks charismatic leadership and is \"starved financially.\"\n\nA recent U.N. report said al-Qaeda maintained a presence in at least 15 Afghan provinces. An offshoot, al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, has operated \"under the Taliban umbrella\" from Kandahar, Helmand and Nimruz provinces, according to the United Nations. In total, al-Qaeda members are estimated to number between several dozen and 500 people.\n\nMohammad Naeem, a Taliban spokesman, denied the presence of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan in an interview with Saudi Arabia's al-Hadath TV that aired Sunday. He said the extremist group had no foothold in the country and no relationship with the Taliban, though there may be \"family ties\" between members of the two organizations.\n\nBut a recent U.N. report said al-Qaeda showed \"no indication of breaking ties\" with the Taliban, with ideological alignment and personal relationships, including intermarriage, keeping the groups close.\n\nAfghanistan analyst Abdul Sayed characterized the relationship as \"cordial and stronger than in the pre-9/11 period.\"\n\nThough the Taliban has \"begun to tighten its control\" over al-Qaeda, the United Nations said in the spring, \"it is impossible to assess with confidence that the Taliban will live up to its commitment to suppress any future international threat emanating from Al-Qaida in Afghanistan.\"\n\nWhat presence does the Islamic State have in Afghanistan?\n\nISIS-K began operating in Afghanistan in 2015, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nStarted by Pakistani national Hafiz Saeed Khan, who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State's then-head Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014, it began as a small band of mostly Pakistani militants operating in the eastern Afghanistan province of Nangahar. Some recruits came from the Taliban, though members of other extremist groups in the region also defected to the Khorasan group, according to the CSIS report.\n\nLike its parent group — the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria — the Afghanistan offshoot has ambitions to hold territory and is known for carrying out brutal attacks on civilians. Shiites are particularly frequent targets.\n\nU.N. Secretary General António Guterres warned in 2019 that after the Islamic State lost its territory in Iraq and Syria, its umbrella group in Afghanistan had access to hundreds of millions of dollars to finance terrorism.\n\nISIS-K has never successfully captured territory in Afghanistan. Instead, its strategy has centered on attacking civilian targets such as mosques, schools and weddings.\n\nThe number of attacks it has carried out annually has decreased in recent years. During the first four months of this year, the United Nations. recorded 77 attacks associated with the group. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombing of a school for girls in Kabul in May that killed more than 85 people, mostly students.\n\nU.S. airstrikes took out key leaders of the Islamic State Khorasan, including its founder, early on. And in 2017, the U.S. military dropped the \"mother of all bombs\" on a cave where fighters were hiding in Nangahar province.\n\nStill, the affiliate group has managed to sustain itself. The United Nations estimates that it retains a core group of some 1,500 to 2,200 fighters in Konar and Nangahar provinces, with smaller cells scattered throughout the country.\n\nWhat threats do the Islamic State and al-Qaeda pose in Afghanistan?\n\nMost analysts agree that al-Qaeda lacks the strength and capability to pose an immediate threat to the United States.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that al-Qaeda's capacity to attack the United States or its allies is \"vastly diminished,\" though he acknowledged that \"remnants\" of the group remained in Afghanistan.\n\nBut given the chance that al-Qaeda will acquire a sanctuary under the Taliban — and the complications to counterterrorism operations that the Taliban victory poses — some say the group could reconstitute itself."}

That acknowledgement at a press briefing came shortly after the U.S. Embassy in Kabul alerted people there that it \"cannot ensure safe passage\" to the airport for the capital city, where Islamist militants had overthrown the U.S.-backed Afghan government with astonishing speed.\n\nSenators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) urged the U.S. not to forget journalists and support staff in Afghanistan. In a letter addressed to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, they said there are still about 200-plus journalists and support staff as well as their families in Afghanistan seeking to evacuate. \"Please ensure that as evacuation flights continue, journalists and support staff are not forgotten,\" the senators said. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said at the briefing Wednesday afternoon that \"we have seen reports that the Taliban, contrary to their public statements and their commitments to our government, are blocking Afghans who wish to leave the country from reaching the airport.\"\n\nThe U.S. military in Kabul and a team in Qatar are \"engaging directly with the Taliban to make clear that we expect them to allow all American citizens, all third-country nationals and all Afghans who wish to leave, to do so safely and without harassment,\" Sherman said. She added that \"so far, it appears that the Taliban's commitment for safe passage for Americans has been solid,\" though she noted that she doesn't know about \"every case.\" But Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin acknowledged Wednesday that the military currently lacks the capability to safely escort Americans in Kabul to the airport for evacuation. \"I don't have the capability to go out and extend operations currently into Kabul,\" Austin said. About 2,000 people have been evacuated in the past 24 hours, Sherman said, with more than 4,840 processed for evacuation over the previous few days.\n\nThe Biden administration has come under intensifying criticism over the chaos in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have seized control just weeks before the U.S. ends its military presence there after nearly two decades of war. Even President Joe Biden's Democratic allies have called for investigations into the government's handling of the withdrawal. The insurgents' rapid advance caught the U.S. off guard, prompting scenes of panic at Hamid Karzai International Airport as thousands of Afghans rushed the tarmac, with some clinging to airplanes even as they took off. About 4,500 U.S. troops were deployed to the airport to facilitate the evacuation. Some troops have reportedly fired warning shots into the air, intending to control the crowds of arrivals. \"The events and images of the last week have been wrenching for all of us,\" Sherman said at the briefing, describing the situation as \"enormously challenging and fluid.\" \"This is an all-hands-on-deck effort, and we aren't going to let up,\" she said."}

We not only see what has been, we see what can be,\" she said in brief remarks outside the Lincoln Memorial. \"We are bold, fearless and ambitious. We are undaunted in our belief that we shall overcome, that we will rise up.\"\n\nFor Harris, the day was steeped in history and significance in more ways than one. She was escorted to the podium by Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, the officer who single-handedly took on a mob of Trump supporters as they tried to breach the Senate floor during the Capitol insurrection, and she was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first woman of color on the court, on a Bible that once belonged to former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She wore a deep purple dress and coat created by two emerging Black designers.\n\nHer rise is historic in any context, another moment when a stubborn boundary falls away, expanding the idea of what's possible in American politics. But it's particularly meaningful because Harris takes office at a moment when Americans are grappling over institutional racism and confronting a pandemic that has disproportionately devastated Black and brown communities.\n\nThose close to Harris say she'll bring an important — and often missing — perspective to the debates on how to overcome the many hurdles facing the new administration.\n\n\"In many folks' lifetimes, we experienced a segregated United States,\" said Lateefah Simon, a civil rights advocate and longtime Harris friend and mentee. \"You will now have a Black woman who will walk into the White House not as a guest but as a second in command of the free world.\"\n\nHarris — the child of immigrants, a stepmother of two and the wife of a Jewish man — \"carries an intersectional story of so many Americans who are never seen and heard.\"\n\nLater during the procession to the vice presidential office building, she was led by her alma mater Howard University's marching band and walked while holding the hand of her grandniece and alongside her husband, stepchildren, sister, brother-in-law and nieces.\n\nShe then quickly got to work, presiding as Senate president for the first time to swear in three new Democratic senators: Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Alex Padilla of California, Harris' replacement."}

She is also the first graduate of a historically Black college and the first member of a Black sorority to do so.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor administered the oath. Sotomayor, the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court, previously administered the vice presidential oath to Biden in 2013.\n\nHarris used two Bibles in the ceremony. The first belonged to Regina Shelton, a family friend whom Harris viewed as a surrogate mother. Harris has used this Bible before, when she took the oath of office as both California attorney general and U.S. senator. The second Bible was previously owned by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black member of the Supreme Court and Harris' lifelong political role model.\n\nIn a recent interview with NPR's Scott Detrow, Harris reflected on the moment that she would take the oath of office as vice president. \"I will be thinking about my mother, who's looking down from heaven. I will be thinking of all the people who are counting on us to lead,\" she said.\n\nHarris often quotes her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, in speeches. A popular refrain she attributes to her mother: \"You may be the first to do many things, but make sure you are not the last.\"\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said of Harris, \"When she takes the oath of office, little girls and boys across the world will know that anything and everything is possible. And in the end, that is America.\"\n\nThe vice president's oath is slightly different than the presidential oath, matching the oath taken by members of Congress:\n\n\"I , _________, do solemnly swear [or affirm] that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.\""}

On behalf of the President and myself, we are honored to welcome you for this visit.\n\nIndia, of course, is a very important partner to the United States. Throughout our history, our nations have worked together, have stood together to make our world a safer and stronger world.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, when you and I last spoke in June, we talked about how our world is more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. And the challenges that we face today have highlighted that fact — be it COVID-19, the climate crisis, and the importance of our shared belief in a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\n\nOn COVID-19, our nations have worked together. Early in the pandemic, India was a vital source of vaccines for other countries. When India experienced a surge of COVID in the country, the United States was very proud to support India in its need and responsibility to vaccinate its people.\n\nAnd I welcome India's announcement that it will soon be able to resume vaccine exports. It is of particular note and admiration that India, I'm told, is currently vaccinating approximately 10 million people a day, as of today.\n\nOn the issue of the climate crisis, I know that India and you take this issue quite seriously. The President and I believe very strongly that the United States working together with India can have not only a profound impact on the people of our respective nations, but on the world itself.\n\nAnd as it relates to the Indo-Pacific, the United States, like India, feels very strongly about the pride of being a member of the Indo-Pacific, but also the fragility and the importance and strength as well of those relationships, including maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific.\n\nFinally, as democracies around the world are under threat, it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our respective countries and around the world and that we maintain what we must do to strengthen democracies at home. And it is incumbent on our nations to, of course, protect democracies in the best interest of the people of our countries.\n\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to discussing how our nations can continue to best work together to strengthen our relationship around our mutual concerns, around the challenges we face, but the opportunities that those challenges also present.\n\nI know from personal experience and from my family of the commitment of the Indian people to democracy and to freedom and to the work that may be done and can be done to imagine and then actually achieve our vision for democratic principles and institutions."}

It should ensure every citizen—regardless of gender—has an equal voice.\n\nAnd free and fair elections that will respect the will of the people.\n\nAt the same time, democracy requires constant vigilance, constant improvement.\n\nIt is a work-in-progress.\n\nAnd today, we know that democracy is increasingly under great strain.\n\nFor 15 consecutive years, we have seen a troubling decline in freedom around the globe.\n\nIn fact, experts believe that this past year was the worst on record for the global deterioration of democracy and freedom.\n\nSo, even as we confront a global health crisis and an economic crisis, it is critical that we continue to defend democracy.\n\nTo that end, the United States is strengthening our engagement with the United Nations and the broader multilateral system.\n\nWe are also rejoining the Human Rights Council.\n\nBecause we know the status of democracy depends on our collective commitment to those values articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe status of democracy also depends fundamentally on the empowerment of women.\n\nNot only because the exclusion of women in decision-making is a marker of a flawed democracy, but because the participation of women strengthens democracy.\n\nAnd that's true everywhere.\n\nLooking around the world, I am inspired by the progress that is being made.\n\nAnd I am proud to report that, while the United States still has work to do, we, too, are making progress—and that women strengthen our democracy everyday.\n\nIn every presidential election for the last 56 years, in the United States, more women have voted than men.\n\nMore women than ever before serve in the United States Congress.\n\nMore women than ever before are their family's breadwinner.\n\nAnd just last week, the President nominated two women to take the helm of two of our 11 combatant commands.\n\nWomen in the United States lead our local, state, and national governments, make major decisions regarding our nation's security, and drive major growth in our economy.\n\nThese are signs of progress. These are signs of strength.\n\nBut, friends, we cannot take this progress for granted.\n\nEspecially now.\n\nCOVID-19 has threatened the economic security, the physical security, and the health of women everywhere.\n\nAs women struggle to get the healthcare they need, the pandemic appears to be reversing the global gains we've made in the fights against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, malnutrition, and maternal and child mortality.\n\nThat's why, on the first day of our Administration, the United States re-engaged as a member state and leader in the World Health Organization.\n\nAnd we are revitalizing our partnership with UN Women, to help empower women worldwide.\n\nHere's the truth:\n\nWhen women face obstacles to obtaining quality healthcare...\n\nWhen women face food insecurity...\n\nWhen women are more likely to live in poverty, and therefore disproportionately impacted by climate change...\n\nMore vulnerable to gender-based violence, and therefore disproportionately impacted by conflict...\n\nWell it's harder for women to fully participate in decision-making.\n\nWhich, in turn, makes it that much harder for democracies to thrive."}

Yet, Harris – along with her husband, Georgetown Law professor Douglas Emhoff – is still, ostensibly, living out of suitcases, unable to move into the private residence reserved for the vice president because it's still undergoing renovations.\n\nIt's unclear why the renovations are taking so long, said one administration official, but it's a situation that has left Harris increasingly and understandably bothered, according to several people who spoke to CNN about her situation. \"She is getting frustrated,\" said another administration official, noting with each passing day the desire to move in to her designated house – a stately, turreted mansion two-and-a-half miles from the White House – grows more intense.\n\nThe second couple continues to live in temporary housing at Blair House, the President's official guest quarters, just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.\n\nThe administration has provided no official explanation for the delay, and a spokesperson for Harris did not respond to CNN's request for comment prior to publication.\n\nCNN has looked at various government contracts, awarded for myriad issues at the vice president's residence over the last few years, many of which detail intensive foundational work. From recently wrapped projects on a retention pond to a replaced tank system for $164,000 from last September, repairs and upkeep appear constant. There's also an ongoing $3.8 million contract for \"plumbing, heating and air-conditioning contractors,\" according to the contract on the United States government spending website.\n\nThe contracts, while substantial, aren't overtly egregious in terms of cost and expectation, considering the home is 9,000-plus square feet and was built in 1893. Tax records from 2018 indicate $119,000 in expenses were used to provide updates and improvements in and around the grounds of the residence, for example. However, the current contracts do not address specifically why the vice president is still not living there, which is leading to growing questions – and agitation – about the pace of the work.\n\nHarris has recently been spotted at her future home, popping in for an hour-long visit three weeks ago, per CNN. Two administration staff with knowledge of the ongoing updates told CNN that Harris – who likes to cook – requested work be done on the kitchen. But Sabrina Singh, Harris' deputy press secretary, said in a statement Sunday that \"there is no work being done on the kitchen at the Naval Observatory residence.\"\n\nIt is not unusual for there to be at least a couple of weeks between residents, so the Naval staff who operate the home can refresh, said Elizabeth Haenle, who served as vice president residence manager and social secretary for former Vice President Dick Cheney. \"From time to time, the Navy will ask the vice president and their respective families to delay moving in so that they have time for maintenance and upgrades that are not easy to perform once the vice president takes up residence,\" Haenle said.\n\nShortly after inauguration, a Harris aide told CNN the vice president wouldn't be immediately moving in, citing the need for some repairs to the home \"that are more easily conducted with the home unoccupied.\" A move-in date was still to be determined at the time. Another administration official told CNN some of the work included renovating the home's chimneys – there are seven working fireplaces – as well as other updates.\n\nLacking the comforts of home\n\nAlthough Blair House provides comfortable, even luxurious, accommodations, Harris and Emhoff's current surroundings lack the creature comforts of a home. Antiques and museum-quality pieces of American history deck each of the 100-plus rooms, which include a gym and a private hair salon. And although the professional, full-time staff of more than a dozen provide amenities as accommodating as a luxury hotel, Blair House does not offer the laid-back vibe Harris and Emhoff are said to prefer when they are home. The couple enjoy a more casual, West Coast informality, with frequent visits from family and large Sunday suppers, the former California senator has said."}

President Joe Biden signed the legislation on Monday after months of infighting among Democrats.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY Network Ohio, Harris said the infrastructure law will help fund apprenticeship programs and repair damaged roads like Interstates 70 and 71.\n\n\"People have to drive over potholes or roads or bridges that are in disrepair,\" she said. \"That means you're getting a flat tire. You're getting something stuck in your tire. It's expensive to replace tires. Insurance doesn't do that.

It will get an estimated $100 million to expand broadband access, $253 million for airports, $1.2 billion for public transportation and $1.4 billion dedicated to water infrastructure projects.\n\nThe Buckeye State can also compete for grants through programs like the Bridge Investment Act, which could help fund a $2.5 billion project to ease congestion on the Brent Spence Bridge that connects Cincinnati and northern Kentucky.\n\nHarris' visit came hours after House Democrats passed the $2 trillion spending bill for social services and climate initiatives, another key priority of the Biden administration.

Interviews with nearly three dozen former and current Harris aides, administration officials, Democratic operatives, donors and outside advisers – who spoke extensively to CNN – reveal a complex reality inside the White House. Many in the vice president's circle fume that she's not being adequately prepared or positioned, and instead is being sidelined. The vice president herself has told several confidants she feels constrained in what she's able to do politically. And those around her remain wary of even hinting at future political ambitions, with Biden's team highly attuned to signs of disloyalty, particularly from the vice president.\n\nShe's a heartbeat away from the presidency now. She could be just a year away from launching a presidential campaign of her own, given doubts throughout the political world that Biden will actually go through with a reelection bid in 2024, something he's pledged to do publicly and privately. Or she'll be a critical validator in three years for a President trying to get the country to reelect him to serve until he's 86.\n\nFew of the insiders who spoke with CNN think she's being well-prepared for whichever role it will be. Harris is struggling with a rocky relationship with some parts of the White House, while long-time supporters feel abandoned and see no coherent public sense of what she's done or been trying to do as vice president. Being the first woman, and first woman of color, in national elected office is historic but has also come with outsized scrutiny and no forgiveness for even small errors, as she'll often point out.\n\nDefenders and people who care for Harris are getting frantic. When they're annoyed, some pass around a recent Onion story mocking her lack of more substantive work, one with the headline, \"White House Urges Kamala Harris To Sit At Computer All Day In Case Emails Come Through.\" When they're depressed, they bat down the Aaron Sorkin-style rumor that Biden might try to replace her by nominating her to a Supreme Court vacancy. That chatter has already reached top levels of the Biden orbit, according to one person who's heard it."}

She wore a \"love is love\" t-shirt as she walked with other Pride-goers to a rally at Freedom Plaza, telling them, \"Happy Pride!\"\n\nShe spoke briefly at the event, advocating for the passage of the Equality Act while expressing her and President Joe Biden's commitment to advancing LGBTQ rights. \"We need to make sure that our transgender community and our youth are all protected. We need, still, protections around employment and housing,\" Harris said, according to NBC Washington. \"There is so much more work to do, and I know we are committed.\"\n\nThe Vice President also observed the fifth anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting on Twitter, paying tribute to the 49 people who were killed at the Orlando gay club on June 12, 2016.\n\n\"Five years ago, 49 LGBTQ+ people and allies were enjoying an evening out at Pulse Nightclub,\" she wrote. \"And then, in an instant, they were gone. Today, we remember those who died and their loved ones-and we recommit to building a world free from gun violence.\"\n\nHarris' post came as President Biden issued his own statement announcing that he'll sign a piece of legislation to name the nightclub a national memorial, which recently passed the House and Senate. He also advocated for stricter gun control and the passage of the Equality Act, acknowledging that the LGBTQ community is disproportionately impacted by gun violence, particularly transgender women of color.\n\n\"In the memory of all of those lost at the Pulse nightclub five years ago, let us continue the work to be a nation at our best-one that recognizes and protects the dignity and safety of every American,\" Biden said in his statement.\n\nThe Biden/Harris administration has made LGBTQ issues one of their priorities, restoring transgender healthcare protections and removing Donald Trump's ban on transgender military members. One of Biden's first executive orders was calling for an end to discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation."}

Good morning. Have a seat. Have a seat. Good morning.\n\nMs. Jackson, I want to thank you. Your leadership is so inspiring, and the whole group of women and men and the community leaders that — that really have been a voice on these issues for so long. For so long. And you hold us to be accountable. And I'm glad to say today we're about to announce that we are taking that charge seriously and have heard you. But please continue with your leadership because it's so important. So, thank you.\n\nAnd good morning, everyone. It is great to be in the house of labor. (Applause.) Good morning. (Laughs.) Good morning. And it's so good to be here at the AFL-CIO.\n\nYou know, the last time I was in this building was in August, and it was early in the morning. My husband, Doug, and I came here to pay our respects and say goodbye to the late, great Rich Trumka. And as we all know, he was a man who lived and breathed solidarity.\n\nAnd I remember that morning because we wanted to just come in and be lowkey. And — and so we walked in the door and there was Liz Shuler. And she greeted me with a big ole warm hug, and we talked that day about Rich's legacy, about the tremendous mark he made and left on our nation.\n\nAnd, Liz, we also talked about the future because that's what I believe Rich would have wanted. And we talked in a way that was not only the focus on what we have achieved, but we talked about what we still have yet to do. And Liz knows what we must do.\n\nWe have worked together for some time now, and I will tell you Liz knows we must protect the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain. She knows we must strengthen those rights. She knows we cannot let up or ever accommodate any amount of progress. We must stay vigilant. And she knows that the Biden-Harris administration will always stand in solidarity with the American labor movement. (Applause.)\n\nSo you all know, and the President and I have been clear: We are determined and we are proud say, perhaps sometimes with a bit of bravado, that we will be the most pro-labor union administration in America's history — (applause) — and we are proud of that. And we are proud of that.\n\nAnd it's for good reason. Because we're clear: When union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. When union jobs are safer, our communities are safer. And when union members go to work, they go to work for all of us. They teach our students and care for our patients. They lay broadband lines and manufacture electric vehicles. And union members replace lead pipes –- (applause) — which is what brings me here today.\n\nOver the years, I have traveled around the country and I have met many parents to talk about this very issue –- so many parents –- parents who are worried that every time they turned on the faucet to get their child a glass of water, that they may be filling that glass with poison; parents who worry, as they make breakfast in the morning or in the evening help their children to brush their teeth, that they are exposing their children to something that could harm them.\n\nAnd the science is clear about what drinking water from a lead pipe can do to the human body. For adults, it can cause an increase in blood pressure and decrease kidney function. For children, it can severely harm mental and physical development. It can stunt growth, slow down learning, and cause irreparable damage to the brain.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that there is no reason in the 21st century for why people are still exposed to this substance that was poisoning people back in the 18th century. There is no good reason."}

Then, on Wednesday night, CNN reported that Symone Sanders, Harris' chief spokesperson and a senior adviser, is also headed out the door.\n\nHarris allies quickly moved to explain both of these departures away as long-planned and not part of any sort of problem within the Veep's office.\n\n\"It's natural for staffers who've thrown their heart and soul into a job to be ready to move on after a few years,\" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki of Sanders' departure on Thursday.\n\nIf you believe that, well, you haven't been paying attention.

And it came at a time when she will provide Democrats the edge with her tiebreaking vote.\n\nHarris' ascent to the vice presidency, combined with the swearing-in of her appointed Senate replacement, Alex Padilla of California, and newly elected Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, made New York's Charles E. Schumer the Senate majority leader.\n\nLike President Joe Biden when he was vice president, Harris will have a variety of largely ceremonial functions as president of the Senate, but she may also find herself doing something Biden never did.\n\nThe 50-50 party split in the Senate puts her in a somewhat similar position to her most recent predecessor, Mike Pence, who was on the West Front of the Capitol for Wednesday's inaugural ceremony. He cast 13 tiebreaking votes over his four-year term, in part because of recent changes in Senate rules on nominations.\n\nHarris' new tiebreaking power also led to Vermont Democrat Patrick J. Leahy resuming the position of Senate president pro tempore, with the constitutional role to fulfill the Senate duties of the vice president when she is not in the Capitol.\n\nIn their opening floor statements following Leahy's election, which came by unanimous consent, both Schumer and Republican leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Biden and Harris and praised the celebration of democracy that took place Wednesday. But neither spoke to the details of the effort to formally organize the Senate, which is the most pressing piece of business.\n\nSchumer and McConnell continue to iron out the terms of the amount of power to be provided the minority party. Any agreement will likely echo the 2001 deal that resulted from the last time the Senate was tied: Democrats will chair committees and Schumer will have control of the floor, but there will be equal membership on committees.\n\n\"This Senate will legislate. It will be active, responsive, energetic and bold. And to my Republican colleagues, when and where we can, the Democratic majority will strive to make this important work bipartisan,\" Schumer said on the floor.\n\n\"Our country deserves for both sides, both parties, to find common ground for the common good everywhere that we can and disagree respectfully where we must,\" McConnell said in his first speech since returning to minority leader status. \"Last fall, the American people chose to elect a narrowly divided House of Representatives, a 50-50 Senate and a president who promised unity.\"\n\nFor those looking for signs of such bipartisanship, there was one Wednesday. The chamber, even without a formal organizing resolution, confirmed Biden's nominee to be director of national intelligence, Avril Haines.\n\nThe 84-10 vote came after a brief hiccup when Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., placed a hold on the nomination until he received a response regarding comments Haines made during her confirmation hearing Tuesday."}

The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private exchange.\n\nThe call came less than a week before Biden and Harris take office and just over a week after Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol and tried to halt the peaceful transition of power after he delivered a speech calling on them to \"fight.\" Five people died, including a Capitol Police officer, and Trump got impeached on a charge of incitement of an insurrection.\n\nWhile Trump has remained largely behind closed doors, without his Twitter bullhorn and fuming since his loss, Pence has been stepping up and fulfilling many of the ceremonial duties of the presidency.\n\nOn Thursday, Pence received a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington from the FBI and other agencies on inauguration security and stopped by to thank White House phone operators, giving them a framed letter of appreciation.

A record number of unaccompanied children crossed into the US this spring, and the throngs of desperate minors present a heart-rending problem as well as a political one.\n\nBiden announced Harris' new assignment on March 24 ahead of an immigration meeting in the White House State Dining Room, telling reporters that he had asked the vice president \"because she's the most qualified person to do it, to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle, and the countries that can help, need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, Harris' aides appeared to \"panic,\" according to one of the officials, out of concern that her assignment was being mischaracterized and could be politically damaging if she were linked to the border, which at the time was facing a growing number of arrivals. But another White House official pushed back on the sentiment, saying the vice president's team wasn't panicked.\n\nOne of the officials said Harris appears eager for a portfolio that will allow her to achieve political victories, especially in foreign policy, an area where she is far less experienced than Biden. Instead, Republican critics and the media have portrayed her new immigration role as a border assignment, potentially opening her up to criticism for the handling of the seemingly intractable problem.\n\nHarris' performance is critical to her future political career, which could well include a run for president. It's also of special concern right now as she prepares to depart for a trip to Guatemala and Mexico next week as part of this project. It will be her first official foray into in-person, in-country talks about the troubles that push Central American migrants toward the US.\n\nHarris and her staff have made it clear that they want to focus narrowly on diplomatic efforts in Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where they believe they are more likely to achieve tangible results in addressing the root causes of migration, like economic despair, said the officials.\n\nThe recent commitments Harris secured from 12 private companies and organizations to invest in the Northern Triangle are one example."}

Voters assume men are qualified to manage a crisis, while women have to prove themselves. It's a double standard that can be credited, at least in part, to what we call the \"imagination barrier.\"\n\nTo date, America's most celebrated wartime leaders have been white men like Lincoln, F.D.R. and Kennedy. In the months ahead, a Black, South Asian American daughter of immigrants—a woman whose very presence shatters the imagination barrier—will join their ranks.\n\nAs vice president, Kamala Harris won't just break the leadership mold—she'll bring valuable new dimensions to the role. With a long history of fighting for underserved populations, Harris is sure to be vocal when it comes to representing the interests of the communities most impacted by the many crises we face. That's a quality voters value in leaders, and an area where women are especially known to excel.\n\nIf you found this article helpful, please consider supporting our independent reporting and truth-telling for as little as $5 per month.\n\nHarris's relationship with long-overlooked constituencies has already translated to more inclusive policy. She's introduced legislation ensuring that federal COVID-19 funding is fairly allocated to underserved communities, championed relief for Black and minority-owned small businesses and proposed universal paid sick leave, paid family and medical leave and easier access to child and elder care.\n\nJust as important as smart policy is effective communication. VP-Elect Harris has developed her own style here, too, earning plaudits for her composure, honesty and steadiness, not to mention her singular ability to invoke joy, even during painful moments for the country.\n\nPerhaps even more notable is Harris's ability to listen. As vice president, she will model leadership that listens to scientists and experts, learns from those she represents, and solicits the advice of community leaders and staff who look like America.\n\nFinally, Harris will display confidence that is rooted in competence. As I wrote in August, her arrival at the pinnacle of executive leadership is not a fluke. She has repeatedly broken barriers to become the first woman, first Black person, and first Black woman to serve in each of her elected positions."}

This casual image of the first female vice president drew considerable criticism for failing to capture Harris in a pose and outfit more appropriate for her historic position in American government. Anna Wintour, Vogue editor-in-chef, and others defended the cover picture by noting that this image best reflects the events of the moment—but has now announced a re-do, with a new limited edition cover for Kamala Harris as a result of the widespread backlash. The cover photo controversy is much more than a disagreement over a styling choice. Madam Vice-President's racial identity is central to understanding why some take exception to this cover. Black women's bodies are political. Their styling choices have cultural meanings that are deeply rooted in cultural norms that carry the legacies of racism, sexism, and respectability politics. Thus, the uproar over Kamala Harris's Vogue cover must be read through a socio-cultural lens that acknowledges the intersectional salience of her racialized and gendered body.\n\nOutside of her historic victory, Kamala Harris's appearance also affords her some possibilities, such as this Vogue cover, not open to other Black women candidates. This multi-ethnic Black woman was once called the \"best-looking attorney general in the country\" by President Barack Obama. She's also appeared on the Hill's 50 Most Beautiful list. Contrast the recognition of Kamala Harris' beauty to the experiences of Stacey Abrams. The former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and founder of Fair Fight plainly stated to the co-hosts of The Breakfast Club, a syndicated hip-hop/urban radio show based in New York City, that \"They [doubters] don't think I'm viable, because I'm a Black woman with natural hair.\" Harris and Abrams have received differential treatment that is not shaped by their political ideologies, fitness for an elected position, nor their ability to represent constituents."}

Well, it is an honor to be here at Hampton University with all of you.\n\nI want to thank the President who — Dr. William Harvey, who warmly greeted us on our arrival.\n\nCongresswoman Luria, thank you for your leadership, for Hampton, for HBCUs, for the state of Virginia, and for our country.\n\nMayor, thank you for the warm welcome as well and for all the work that you have done.\n\nI also want to thank Chairman Bobby Scott, the congressman who represents Virginia. He is a huge supporter of our HBCUs and actually is in a committee hearing, I believe today, advocating for the infrastructure bill that we are proposing. And that includes a significant contribution that we intend to make to our HBCUs around infrastructure, as well as research.\n\nI believe we are at the beginning of a new era. I believe that we, in this new era, are more interconnected and interdependent than ever before, as highlighted by the things that you, as our young — our nation's young leaders have witnessed in just this last year and a half.\n\nWe've seen a pandemic, which has really emphasized the significance of our mutual investment in the issue of global health. We have seen cyberattacks, which tells us the role and the use of technology not only for good, as we know it in our everyday lives, but can be weaponized.\n\nWe know it when we think about climate and the extreme weather we've been experiencing — Ida — in terms of the hurricanes; the floods that have happened; in my home state of California, the wildfires. We used to refer to \"wildfire season.\" We don't do that anymore. It's all — year-round.\n\nYou all are the leaders in this new era because, in particular, our nation and our world will require the smart people that you are to lead on issues that require dedication, and a development of skills around science and technology and engineering and math.\n\nAnd Hampton University is one of the leaders — I say, as a Howard graduate. (Laughs.) Couldn't let that go, guys. (Laughs.) I say that knowing, as Vice President, what you're doing here at Hampton University: The partnership between Hampton and NASA — the fact that, I believe, there are four satellites because of Hampton that are right now orbiting, giving us valuable — invaluable information that allows us to not only predict, but to analyze what is happening in our world and in our — and atmosphere.\n\nThis is extraordinary work that is happening. And I'm here to say, as Vice President of the United States, that our HBCUs are some of the great leaders in this vital work that must happen in the new era that not only is an era for our country, but for the world.\n\nSo I'm very proud to be here. And I think about the world — of the challenges, but I think about it in the context of HBCUs. And I am reminded Hampton University educated Mary Jackson — NASA's first Black female engineer. It is from Hampton University that we have Dr. Cooper, who is working on the current Mars mission at NASA right now.\n\nToday, Hampton is the first and only HBCU to fully control a NASA mission. I was just upstairs getting the most recent information on the AIM Satellite, as an example.\n\nAnd so, when we talk about the role of HBCUs on this issue, let's be very clear that HBCUs are not only competing; HBCUs are leading. And it is for that reason that it is in the best interest of our nation, including our national security, to invest in our HBCUs. So, that's why I'm here today, including the fact that this is a week that most of us — year-round, but this week — formally celebrate the role of our HBCUs in our nation.\n\nSo, the agenda for the President and me includes not only doing everything we can to lift up our HBCUs, but to know that if we are to invest in the strength of our nation, we must invest in our HBCUs. And that is why, through our Build Back agenda, that we are making a historic investment in research and development.\n\nOne of the things that you all know is that, historically, our HBCUs have done extraordinary research work. But over the years, some of the facilities have experienced the wear and tear, and we need to invest in allowing our HBCUs to do what all universities should have the ability to do, all education facilities should have the ability to do, which is to upgrade.\n\nI was upstairs, on the roof, admiring that impressive telescope. And one of the points that was made by the professor is that as technology evolves, pieces get smaller, they get less expensive. It makes it more easy for HBCUs to adapt to, then, the new technology and to bring it in, but they need the support. So that's the other point of our emphasis.\n\nAnd then, the point also is about the impact on all of this on our economy. Right? So the demand for STEM workers is high throughout our nation and, frankly, throughout the world. STEM occupations are expected to grow at twice the rate of all other occupations in the next decade.\n\nFor women in the workforce, for women of color in particular — for Black women — STEM careers will help narrow the pay gap. And we must ensure that all people are represented in the fields of STEM.\n\nAnd I'm reminded and think of, for example, the issue of what I call \"machine learning\" — AI — and what that means. Because artificial intelligence is fueling so much of how our systems are analyzing information.\n\nBut understand: Artificial intelligence is, at its core, machine learning. What do we know about any kind of learning? What you learn will likely be a function of who's teaching you and what their life experience and perspective is.\n\nSo, we want to make sure that in this era, where AI is informing so many decisions, that the people who are teaching the machines represent the full gamut of those who will be affected by what the machines decide to do.\n\nSo all of these are critical and important aspects of why I am here today and why the work here at Hampton University, and at so many of our HBCUs, is critically important to all people in our country.\n\nAnd the last point I will make is that, for me, at the core of this is also the importance of self-determination, understanding that this is about ensuring that when we invest in our HBCUs, that we have full participation in our society and in these systems that have an impact on a broad range of people.\n\nAnd that is why the dedication and the investment of our administration and all people should understand the significance of our HBCUs.\n\nSo with that, I am so happy and proud to be with these leaders — with these young leaders. And, Vincent, why don't we start our discussion."}

Our official bilateral relationship began in 1957, but of course, there are longer — and longer-standing ties that connect the people of our nations.\n\nOver the years, many Americans have traveled to Ghana to remember the history of slavery and to honor their roots and understand their ancestry. And the African diaspora in the United States, including my home state of California, is significant, and our nation is stronger for it.\n\nWe — these two nations — share a commitment to democracy. Last December, the people of Ghana voted in a free and fair election that demonstrated your nation's commitment to democratic principles and institutions.\n\nWe share a view that all people must have a voice in their future, that our democracies are stronger when everyone participates and weaker when anyone is left out.\n\nWe also share a commitment to global health. None of us have been immune from the ravages of the pandemic. We recognize our shared responsibility to collaborate, to share resources to not only continue to address the effects of COVID-19, but to prepare for the next pandemics.\n\nAnd in that way, the United States is proud to be a member of COVAX and the African Union, and has donated more than 1.2 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Ghana. And I'm proud to announce that we will, shortly, send more than 1.3 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nFinally, we are working together to expand our economic relationship. You and I have talked about that briefly before we came in. American companies continue to ramp up in Ghana, understanding the significance of the work that they do there to America's economy, much less to the partnership between Ghana and the United States.\n\nAnd they do this also because they have confidence in the government of Ghana and the environment, Mr. President, that you have created, which allows for some confidence in the respect and upholding of the rule of law and human rights.\n\nAnd so, with all of that, we look forward to continuing to work together on all of these issues, including in the context of the United Nations Security Council.

She has a challenging job, a hard job, and she has a great supportive team of people around her. But other than that, I'm not going to have any more comments on those reports.\"\n\nStill, conversations are now underway in the West Wing about how to better support Harris' team, one source close to the White House said.\n\nThat help from the West Wing is a sign that the spiraling narrative could start to affect Harris, who is considered the next in line to lead the Democratic Party – with a potential for a presidential run coming as soon as 2024 if President Joe Biden decides not to seek reelection. Biden has said he does intend to run.\n\nTop White House officials and aides to the vice president went on the record to defend Harris and Flournoy, calling reports of infighting and dysfunction overblown or simply untrue. And Harris' outside allies and advisers – like influential adviser Minyon Moore and Democratic strategist Bakari Sellers – quickly took to Twitter, looking to drown out the criticism.\n\nOn Friday, Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, a longtime friend of Flournoy, said in a statement to CNN: \"Vice President Harris and her team are off to the fastest and strongest start of any Vice President I have seen. She's Delivering for the American people on immigration, small business, voting rights, and economic growth. The President's trust and confidence in her is obvious when you see them in the Oval Office together.\"\n\n\"The results speak for themselves: a decline of border arrivals from the Northern Triangle, improved vaccine equity, and increased economic opportunities for women.

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been on a months-long slide toward historically poor polling numbers, but yesterday's USA Today/Suffolk poll was even worse for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBiden's approval rating hit yet another a new low, this time at 38%, but Harris' dropped to 28%.\n\nA 51% majority of respondents said they disapprove of the job Harris is doing as VP.\n\nAt this early stage of a modern presidency, Harris' numbers in the USA Today/Suffolk poll are unprecedented.\n\nThe closest comparison — which involves slightly different methodology and margins of error — would be former Vice President Dick Cheney, the most unpopular US vice president in polling history. He bottomed out at 30% in Gallup's tracking survey, but that wasn't until the end of former President George W. Bush's second term in 2007.\n\nHarris has taken on thorny assignments early on in her tenure as VP, including running point on the administration's efforts at handling the migration surge of asylum seekers at the southern border.\n\nAs Insider's Robin Bravender reported in late October, Harris aides are quietly worried about the 2024 presidential election, should Biden forego a reelection bid, with former 2020 primary rival and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posing a potential threat.\n\nThe USA Today/Suffolk poll had a sample of 1,000 registered voters nationwide and a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."}

Trump assailed Raffensperger for refusing to falsely declare Trump the winner of the election in the Peach State.\n\n\"Have y'all heard about that recorded conversation?\" Harris asked with cars honking in the audience. \"Well it was, yes, certainly, the voice of desperation, most certainly that, and it was a bald, bald-faced, bold abuse of power by the President of the United States.\"\n\nHarris' remarks were the first on-camera reaction from the incoming administration to the bombshell call obtained by CNN and first reported by the Washington Post on Sunday afternoon.\n\nEarlier, Bob Bauer, a senior adviser to President-elect Joe Biden, in a statement said it, \"captures the whole, disgraceful story about Donald Trump's assault on American democracy.\"\n\nThe soon-to-be-sworn-in Vice President tracked through Trump and other Republicans' failed attempts to overturn the election on false allegations of widespread voter fraud – a charge that has been found to have no credible evidence.\n\n\"And then look at the most recent history, which is that after you elected, you turned Georgia blue, you elected Joe Biden President of the United States, you elected the first black woman in the history of our country to be the Vice President of the United States, and they have the gall to suggest you didn't know what you were doing, you must have gone about it in a way that was illegitimate,\" she said.\n\nTrump's audio call with Georgia secretary of state CNN has obtained the full January 2 audio call between President Donald Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump is joined on the call by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and several lawyers. CNN obtained the audio from a source who was on the call and had direct knowledge of the conversation. CNN has redacted the name of one individual about whom Trump made unsubstantiated claims.\n\nHarris also slammed Trump for calling the upcoming January 5 Senate runoff elections \"illegal and invalid,\" and that he was \"suggesting that the people of Georgia are trying to commit a crime.\"\n\nThese strong remarks came after Harris spoke about the importance of the Senate while on Instagram Live with artist and musician Janelle Monáe, defiantly stating that she would be sworn in, in just under three weeks, as Vice President no matter the attempts to obstruct or delay.\n\n\"And when I am sworn in on January 20, which I will be whether Donald Trump likes that or not, the sad bittersweet moment about that is that there will be no more Black woman in the United States Senate,\" Harris said.\n\nThis is also Harris' first time speaking about the lack of Black women in the Senate once she resigns since California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla was announced as her successor by the state's Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom chose the first Latino in state history for the role.\n\nSpeaking before Harris, Senate candidate Jon Ossoff said Trump was actively attempting to \"disenfranchise Black voters\" in the state.\n\n\"That is a direct attack on our democracy. And if David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler had one piece of steel in their spines, one shred of integrity, they would be out here defending Georgia voters from that kind of assault,\" Ossoff said.\n\nBoth Harris and Biden, who will be returning to Atlanta on Monday, are making their final push into the Peach State in hopes that the Democratic Party will gain control of the Senate and start their administration with a unified government."}

The images show Detroit with neighboring Lake St. Clair, a changing Florida coastline, and areas of Navajo Country in Arizona. They will add to the wealth of data helping us monitor crop health and water used for irrigation, manage vital natural resources, and track the impacts of climate change.\n\nThe new images, all acquired Oct. 31, also provide data about the changing landscapes of the Himalayas and Australia, adding to Landsat's unparalleled data record that spans nearly 50 years of space-based Earth observation.\n\n\"I truly believe space activity is climate action. Space activity is education. Space activity is also economic growth. It is also innovation and inspiration. And it is about our security and our strength,\" the vice president said. \"When it comes to our space activity, there is limitless potential. ... So, as we go forth from here, let us continue to seize the opportunity of space.\"\n\nHarris and Nelson also discussed NASA's announcement of a new Earth Venture Mission-3 (EVM-3). Investigation of Convective Updrafts (INCUS) will study how tropical storms and thunderstorms develop and intensify, which will help improve weather and climate models.\n\n\"Our NASA experts today provided us a sweeping look at the many ways we need to understand our planet better, from drought and urban heat, to our oceans and the many landscapes we can see changing from the heavens,\" said Nelson. \"The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to making real progress on the climate crisis to benefit the next generation, and NASA is at the heart of that work.\"\n\nNASA, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and USGS, is among the federal agencies that conduct climate research and provide climate data critical for agencies and organizations worldwide.

I am honored to lead our National Space Council.\"\n\nHarris \"intends to put her own personal stamp on the Council,\" a senior administration official said.

And not really focus, perhaps, as much on big displays, but on getting the work done.\"\n\nSenior officials would not list where chairing the National Space Council lies among Harris' other portfolio priorities, which now include leading diplomatic efforts to stem the flow of migrants in the Northern Triangle and the administration's efforts to expand broadband high-speed internet.\n\n\"She's got a lot on her plate, as was originally said, and this is just one more big task that she is taking on because it's important. It's important to the President, and the country,\" the official said.\n\nThe vice president will swear in newly confirmed NASA administrator Bill Nelson on Monday.\n\nHarris, as vice president, has engaged repeatedly with members from NASA – speaking with astronauts Shannon Walker and Kate Rubins virtually to mark Women's History Month in March, as well as with astronaut Victor Glover in February.\n\nThe process of finding a civilian executive secretary, who would be appointed by the President, is still ongoing, official said.\n\nThere's no official date for the first formal meeting of the National Space Council, but senior administration officials said Harris will get started soon."}

She'd struggled with crippling amounts of debt. Her home state of California was locking down again because of a virus she believed was fiction. Fast, informative and written just for locals. ArrowRight As she walked east along the Mall on Wednesday, wearing a backpack emblazoned with the American flag, Ashli Babbitt was elated.\n\n\"It was amazing to get to see the president talk,\" Babbitt said, beaming in a video she streamed on Facebook early Wednesday afternoon that was later published by TMZ. \"We are now walking down the inaugural path to the Capitol building. Three million-plus people.\"\n\nThere was no crowd of three million: just a mob, lawless and maskless, that numbered in the thousands. Babbitt's mission, which she had repeatedly avowed on social media, was to restore American democracy. But she was about to take part in a riot that would go down in history as one of that democracy's most grievous attacks.\n\nAfter a long but undistinguished military career and years of personal travails, Babbitt — a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from Southern California who once supported Barack Obama — believed she had found a cause that gave her life purpose. Within hours, that cause would bring her life to a violent end.\n\nHers was the first death reported Jan. 6, when rioters incited by President Trump overran the seat of the U.S. government. In the coming days there would be others. Brian D. Sicknick, a 42-year-old Capitol police officer who died after being injured while trying to push back the mob. Rosanne Boyland, Kevin D. Greeson and Benjamin Phillips, who died of medical emergencies during the chaos.\n\nBut it was Babbitt, fatally shot by police as she attempted to leap through the broken window of a door inside the Capitol, whose name would almost instantly become synonymous with the feverish movement that had propelled thousands of Americans to desecrate a pillar of their government.\n\nTo her comrades in the movement, she was a martyr. Back in California, Babbitt's brother, Roger Witthoeft, didn't even know she had attended the protest before their dad, distraught, called him with news of the shooting. He found a video online.\n\n\"There was no doubt that it was my beautiful sister,\" Witthoeft recalled.\n\nBabbitt's journey — illuminated through her extensive social media activity, court and military records, and interviews with some who knew her — was one of paranoid devotion and enthusiasm that only increased as Trump's fortunes waned.\n\nShe avidly followed the QAnon conspiracy theory, convinced that Trump was destined to vanquish a cabal of child abusers and Satan-worshiping Democrats. She believed Wednesday would be \"the storm,\" when QAnon mythology holds that Trump would capture and execute his opponents.\n\nLong before she embraced those ideas, Babbitt was on a rocky path. She was loyal but rebellious, devoted to her country but often unable to get along with those who shared it. A believer in American pluck and free enterprise, she struggled in her attempts to run a small pool-service company outside San Diego.\n\nShe served more than a decade in the armed forces but chafed under the military hierarchy. Six of those years were spent in an Air National Guard unit whose mandate is to defend the Washington region and respond to civil unrest. Its nickname: the Capital Guardians.\n\nLike so many others, she believed Jan. 6 would be not a day of infamy, but an end to her troubles.\n\n\"Nothing will stop us,\" she tweeted Jan. 5. \"They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!\"\n\nIt was the last thing she would write.\n\n'Absolutely unafraid'\n\nShe was fed up with her executive officer. It was 2014, and Babbitt — along with much of her Air National Guard unit, then stationed at the Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates — detested him, according to a former staff sergeant in the unit who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears backlash online.\n\nBut despite her reputation for being outspoken, she kept herself in check. Then one day, the executive officer slipped new papers into a briefing binder shortly before quizzing service members on its contents.\n\nBabbitt asked for permission to speak freely, the former staff sergeant said, and the executive officer granted it — \"which was a huge mistake for that captain.\""}

More important, number two, he explained his uses of force,\" CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said.\n\nRittenhouse's testimony gave jurors the ability to hear what he thought at the time and whether he believed he was in danger – a claim the prosecution, ultimately failed to undermine, former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said.\n\n\"They (prosecutors) pointed out some sort of minor inconsistencies and things he said on the night of, and said later, but nothing that undermines sort of the core defense argument, which was, he was attacked,\" Honig told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Friday. \"Every time he shot, he was attacked.\"\n\n\"The prosecution did not make enough of a dent in Kyle Rittenhouse,\" Honig added.\n\nState did not prove Rittenhouse provoked violence\n\nWhat the trial came down to, according to civil rights attorney Charles F. Coleman Jr. were two competing narratives: one of Rittenhouse being a victim who was attacked, and one of being a vigilante who provoked the violence.\n\n\"The jury bought the narrative of Kyle Rittenhouse being a victim, they thought that his self-defense claim was a lot stronger than the prosecution's provocation claim,\" he said."}

Some Americans were horrified by the images of a teenager toting a powerful semiautomatic rifle on a city street during racial justice demonstrations, a reminder of the extent of open carry laws in the United States. Others saw a well-meaning young man who had gone to keep the peace and provide medical aid, a response to the sometimes destructive protests that had roiled American cities in the summer of 2020.\n\nImage Justin Blake, upper left, Jacob Blake's uncle, and others listen to the verdict while standing outside the Kenosha County Courthouse.

Gavin Newsom of California, said the verdict served as a message to \"armed vigilantes\" that \"you can break the law, carry around weapons built for a military, shoot and kill people, and get away with it.\"\n\nPresident Biden said the acquittal would \"leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included,\" but he also urged demonstrators to remain peaceful. \"I stand by what the jury has concluded,\" he told reporters earlier. \"The jury system works, and we have to abide by it.\"\n\nRepublicans, like Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said that \"justice has been served.\" Rebecca Kleefisch, the leading Republican candidate for Wisconsin governor, said that \"the justice system worked\" and called the prosecution \"a complete disgrace.\"\n\nShortly after noon on Friday, the jury forewoman, wearing a jean jacket and a face mask, handed the verdicts to a court official, who passed them to Judge Bruce Schroeder for review. As the verdict was read, Mr. Rittenhouse's mother and sisters cried, and friends and family of the men Mr. Rittenhouse fatally shot clutched each other's hands and wept. Several jurors, appearing fatigued, shifted uncomfortably in their seats or folded their arms across their chests.\n\nOutside the courthouse, quiet gave way to shouts from supporters of Mr. Rittenhouse. Gov. Tony Evers had prepared for any unrest after the verdict by authorizing 500 Wisconsin Army National Guard troops. As evening fell, only a few demonstrators holding signs remained on the courthouse steps."}

(AP) — Prosecutors in Kyle Rittenhouse's murder trial may have lost their best chance at convicting the Illinois man of something when the judge threw out a charge that Rittenhouse was a minor in possession of a dangerous weapon.\n\nRittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them, with an AR-15-style rifle during a chaotic protest against police brutality in Kenosha last year. A jury deliberated about 3 1/2 days before finding Rittenhouse not guilty on Friday of five felony charges, including a murder charge that could have carried a life in prison sentence.\n\nThat jury never got to consider the gun possession charge — one that at one time had seemed a slam-dunk for the prosecution. Rittenhouse was 17 at the time, and there was no dispute that he was armed the night of the shootings with a Smith and Wesson AR-style semi-automatic rifle strapped to his chest.\n\nThough the charge was only a misdemeanor — punishable by a maximum nine months in jail — it might have offered the jury a way to convict Rittenhouse of a lesser crime if they were persuaded by his self-defense claims but agreed with prosecutors that he made a poor decision to carry a rifle on the streets of Kenosha.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nHours before closing arguments began on Monday, Judge Bruce Schroeder granted a defense motion to toss out the weapons charge. Rittenhouse attorneys Mark Richards and Corey Chirafisi pointed to an exception in the law that they said allows minors to possess shotguns and rifles as long as they're not short-barreled.\n\nAssistant District Attorney James Kraus argued that the exception renders the state's prohibition on minors possessing dangerous weapons meaningless. But when he acknowledged that Rittenhouse's rifle's barrel was longer than 16 inches, the minimum barrel length allowed under state law, Schroeder dismissed the charge.\n\nTo Kenosha-based defense attorney Michael Cicchini, the statute clearly requires a weapon to be short-barreled to apply, and the judge made the right call.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be much ambiguity here,\" he said. \"(The charge) should have been dismissed earlier.\"\n\nThe current wording of the overarching law seems clear: \"Any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.\" A lead-in paragraph defines dangerous weapon as several things, including \"any firearm, loaded or unloaded.\"\n\nThe subsection that defense attorneys relied upon to seek dismissal reads: \"This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 ...\" That section of law isn't specific to minors, but rather forbids any person from having a short-barreled shotgun or rifle.\n\n\"We knew from the beginning, that if you read that statute correctly, he was legal in having that firearm,\" Richards said Friday after Rittenhouse was cleared of the remaining charges."}

After three and a half days of deliberation, a jury acquitted Rittenhouse of all felony counts, including first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide, and two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety.\n\nRittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, lived in Antioch, Illinois; he crossed state lines, picked up an illegally obtained AR15 rifle from a friend's stepfather, and embedded with a self-described militia purportedly protecting a local business from demonstrators out after curfew. That week, Kenosha saw sustained protests after local police shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, in the back with his children watching. Rittenhouse — a former police cadet and a Trump supporter with a strong \"Blues Lives Matter\" social-media presence — told a right-wing media outlet that he was there doing his \"job,\" though he had taken it upon himself to help guard the car dealership. And when a confrontation broke out, Rittenhouse fired at a group of people appearing to chase him, killing 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum. Shortly after that, he shot and killed 26-year-old Anthony Huber, also injuring 26-year-old Gaige Grosskreutz.\n\nWith Fox News personalities hailing him as a hero, and even the then-president defending him, Rittenhouse was charged with first-degree intentional homicide days later. Kenosha prosecutors also charged him with two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety, one count of first-degree reckless homicide, one count of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, one count of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18, and also for violating curfew. He pleaded not guilty to all, claiming he shot his victims in self-defense. His trial began on November 2.\n\nWhat did the prosecution argue?\n\nIn his opening statements, prosecutor Thomas Binger emphasized that although hundreds of people \"experienced the night of August 25, experienced the chaos — the only one who killed anyone was the defendant, Kyle Rittenhouse.\" Binger positioned Rittenhouse as the instigator of deadly conflict, one of the outsiders drawn to unrest in Kenosha \"like moths to a flame.\""}

He killed two unarmed people\n\nKyle Rittenhouse, who shot three men at a riot in Kenosha, killing two of them, was acquitted of all criminal charges.\n\nHe has been hailed as a hero. He has been feted by politicians, including Donald Trump. He has been compared to John Wayne as a symbol of law-abiding people fighting back against lawlessness. When he took a rifle to a protest over the earlier police shooting that left Jacob Blake paralyzed, Rittenhouse said his intention was to protect property against violence.\n\nBut the two men Rittenhouse killed were unarmed. John Wayne never shot an unarmed man.\n\nRittenhouse was acquitted because of changes in the legal understanding of self-defense in recent years. Based on the Rittenhouse verdict, the rest of us are now unsafe around anyone with a gun.\n\nRittenhouse had been guarding an auto dealership at which several cars had been set on fire when he was confronted by Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse killed. Evidence showed that Rosenbaum was aggressive and lunged for Rittenhouse's rifle while cursing him. Rittenhouse testified that he feared that Rosenbaum would seize the rifle and shoot him. The jury found this fear to be reasonable and this may be a fair interpretation of the current law of self-defense in Wisconsin.\n\nBut that is precisely the problem. No one actually knows what Rosenbaum intended. Rittenhouse admitted that he pointed his rifle at him. Rosenbaum might have intended simply to disarm a dangerous man.\n\nThe acquittal means that the person holding the gun gets to decide who lives and who dies.\n\nYou can see where this interpretation of self-defense can lead in the trial of the three men who were convicted of killing Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black jogger running through a suburb of Brunswick, Georgia. One of the men charged, Travis McMichael, said that Arbery lunged for his gun.\n\nMcMichael was convicted of malice murder, so this defense failed. But George Barnhill, the second prosecutor in the case, who later recused himself, refused to prosecute on just this basis: \"at the point Arbery grabbed the shotgun, under Georgia Law, [Travis] McMichael was allowed to use deadly force to protect himself.\"\n\nJohn Wayne would not have shot a man he knew was unarmed, as Rittenhouse did. The Duke would have defended himself against non-lethal force by the use of his fists.\n\nAfter Rittenhouse killed Rosenbaum, he made a phone call to a friend saying that he had just killed someone. He did not seek medical attention for the man on the ground. He did not call the police. Instead, he continued his armed patrolling.\n\nAnthony Huber, the second man killed, considered Rittenhouse to be dangerous. Huber's girlfriend said in an interview that Huber rushed Rittenhouse to protect her and others nearby. Huber struck Rittenhouse with a skateboard he always carried and reached for Rittenhouse's rifle. That is when Rittenhouse shot him once, fatally wounding him.\n\nClearly, Huber was not trying to shoot Rittenhouse, but to disarm him. As the events of that night demonstrated, he was not wrong to fear that Rittenhouse was irresponsibly dangerous. Huber's courage cost him his life.\n\nJohn Wayne would not have fired his weapon at Huber, just as John Wayne would have led the police to Rosenbaum's body.\n\nIronically, there was someone in Kenosha that night who embodied the grace and restraint of John Wayne—Gaige Grosskreutz, the man Rittenhouse wounded after killing Huber.\n\nGrosskreutz, who was at the protest to provide medical care, and who was carrying a handgun, was told that Rittenhouse had shot someone and was trying to get away. He saw Rittenhouse fire at Huber and moved directly toward him with his own gun visible. He and Rittenhouse confronted each other. Grosskreutz did not fire. Rittenhouse did.\n\nRittenhouse did not hesitate to shoot, did not assess the situation, did not act like an adult who understood the responsibility of possessing a firearm.\n\nRittenhouse is alive today because Grosskreutz did not shoot. By the jury's reasoning, he had every right to kill Rittenhouse as they pointed guns at each other.\n\nThis is where the madness of the current interpretation of self-defense has brought us."}

Pool/CBS News\n\nRittenhouse was 17 last year when he traveled 20 miles from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, which had been racked with protests in the wake of the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake. That shooting and the response in Kenosha - protests that turned destructive - became part of the national reckoning over police use of force against Black people following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis the previous May at the hands of police.\n\nRittenhouse, armed with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle, joined others who said they were intent on protecting private property from potential damage on Aug. 25. During his trial, prosecutors argued that the teenager was a \"wannabe soldier\" who went looking for trouble that night. Rittenhouse countered that he fired in self-defense after he was attacked and was in fear for his life.\n\nThe shootings quickly made Rittenhouse a rallying cry for supporters of Second Amendment rights and those angered by the sometimes violent protests seen in some American cities after Floyd's death."}

But coming just days apart, they laid bare a dangerous and long-running current in the fight for racial equality: The move by some white Americans to grab guns and take their own stand against perceptions of lawlessness, particularly by Black people.\n\nThe two cases, which ended with an acquittal for Rittenhouse last week and guilty verdicts for Arbery's killers on Wednesday, highlighted polarizing issues about gun and self-defense laws, and racial injustice.\n\nThey also forced the questions: Who or what is being protected? And from whom? Should peace of mind for white Americans come at the expense of the protection and safety of Black Americans?\n\n\"So much of this issue about protection and safety is about the safety and the protection of whites or white property,\" said Carol Anderson, historian and professor of African American studies at Emory University. \"There is a hubris of whiteness. The sense that it is on me to put Black lives back into their proper place.\"\n\nArbery, a Black man, was chased and shot to death by white men suspicious of an outsider in their predominantly white Georgia neighborhood. In Wisconsin, while both Rittenhouse and the three men he shot were white, the encounter was triggered by the 17-year-old's decision to travel from his Illinois home to Kenosha and arm himself with an AR-15 rifle, bent on protecting local businesses from Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nThe unmistakable connection: The idea that white men who perceive a problem \"should grab a gun and wade into trouble and then claim self-defense,\" said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.\n\n\"This is a product of a gun culture. It's also a product of laws ... that give white men with guns the ability to create chaos and sometimes get away with it,\" said Waldman, author of \"The Second Amendment: A Biography.\"\n\nThe two coinciding trials highlighted deep racial rifts within American society, particularly following last year's broad movement for racial justice that swept the country in the wake of George Floyd's murder.\n\nBoth also came at the end of a year that began with an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, in which an overwhelmingly white crowd of supporters of former President Donald Trump, enraged with the idea that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from them, stormed the building in an effort to take ownership of the government.\n\nThe impetus for raiding the Capitol, Anderson said, was the unfounded claim that there was massive amounts of voter fraud in cities where there were sizable Black populations, \"the notion that Black folks voting is what stole the election.\"\n\n\"That's the thing about vigilantism, it's that something precious to me, for me, for my community, is being stolen and it's being stolen by the unworthy, by the undeserving,\" Anderson said.\n\nWhite vigilantism signifies \"the need to keep the Black population, particularly the Black male population, under surveillance and under control,\" said writer Darryl Pinckney. It has evolved over time, but there is a long history in the U.S. of people taking the law into their own hands — and of white Americans using that as a pretext to violently enforce racial boundaries."}

Most jurors stopped taking notes, as they leaned toward the screens to watch recordings that have been played millions of times around the world.\n\nA solemn Rittenhouse also appeared to be paying close attention to the videos, taking notes and whispering to his lawyers while the sound of his gunshots rang out in the courtroom. He purposefully looked away, however, whenever images appeared on the screen of the men he shot injured and, in one case, dying.\n\nRittenhouse, a then-17-year-old from north suburban Antioch, crossed state lines and volunteered to patrol downtown Kenosha amid turmoil surrounding the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer. Carrying an AR-15-style rifle that police say a friend illegally purchased for him, Rittenhouse fatally shot two people and injured a third.\n\nRittenhouse has pleaded not guilty, arguing he killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz in self-defense.\n\nWith Kenosha police Detective Martin Howard on the witness stand, prosecutors walked jurors through roughly a half-dozen videos taken that night. They started with interviews Rittenhouse gave to journalists before the shootings, in which he boasted about being a medic and unknowingly foreshadowed his criminal defense.\n\n\"People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,\" Rittenhouse said as he stood in front of a used car lot in one clip. \"And part of my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I'm running into harm's way. That's why I have my rifle; I've gotta protect myself obviously.\"\n\nWearing blue plastic gloves and a homemade first-aid kit around his waist, the video shows Rittenhouse walking through Kenosha streets calling out for anyone who needs a medic. He provided aid to a few people that night, according to earlier testimony, but Rittenhouse — a lifeguard who had not yet finished high school — is not a trained emergency medical technician.\n\nEarlier in the day, a social media influencer who recorded Rittenhouse before the shootings testified about his observations that night. Koerri Washington said he remembered thinking an armed Rittenhouse looked \"young\" and \"nervous\" as he chain-smoked in a gas station parking lot. He didn't single him out as problematic, however.\n\n\"It wasn't like I thought he was going to go and mow a bunch of people down,\" Washington said.\n\nJurors saw a video, taken later in the evening, in which four shots rang out after Rosenbaum chased Rittenhouse through the car lot. Shortly before the chase, Rittenhouse could be heard yelling, \"friendly! friendly\" to indicate he was not looking for a conflict.\n\nThe defense has emphasized that Rosenbaum had been menacing people with a chain that night, but Howard testified that Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at Rittenhouse before the shooting and was not carrying a weapon.\n\n\"I can only see a plastic bag,\" he said.\n\nProsecutors played a video of bystanders trying to help Rosenbaum after he was shot. They scream about trying to put pressure on the wounds, while a dying Rosenbaum takes loud, rattling breaths.\n\n\"Stay with me!\" one man yells.\n\nAs the bloody images played on screens around the courtroom, Rittenhouse turned his head so he could not see any of them. He only looked at the monitors again when he heard the recording stop.\n\nAfter shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse ran up one of Kenosha's main streets until he tripped and fell. Once on the ground, a man tried to kick him but missed. Rittenhouse fired at him in return and missed him.\n\nHuber then hit Rittenhouse with his skateboard, and the teen fired a fatal shot into his chest. An armed Grosskreutz took a step toward Rittenhouse and was shot in the arm.\n\nThe jurors later watched video of Grosskreutz, a trained medic, instruct a bystander on how to tie a tourniquet around his arm to stop the massive bleeding."}

Having seen Rittenhouse already kill one man, he assumed he would be next.\n\n\"I was never trying to kill the defendant,\" Grosskreutz said. \"That was never something I was trying to do. In that moment, I was trying to preserve my own life. But doing so, also, taking the life of another is not something I am capable or comfortable of doing. It goes against almost a lifelong ethical code in regards to medicine.\"\n\nIn putting a human face on what had so far been a video-heavy case that centered around very technical legal questions, Grosskreutz seemed to bolster Rittenhouse's self-defense claim as he testified that he believed some people chasing Rittenhouse down the street intended to hurt the teen.

He acknowledged, however, that he reached for the teen's AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle just before Rittenhouse shot him in the arm.\n\nWearing a hat with \"paramedic\" printed on it during protests, Grosskreutz testified, he and a friend had organized a medical corps to help people needing assistance at demonstrations in Milwaukee during the summer of 2020 after George Floyd's death. He also traveled to Kenosha on Aug. 25 to provide medic services to people protesting the shooting days earlier of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer.\n\nLike Rittenhouse, Grosskreutz carried a gun and provided first aid to people injured during the demonstrations. But unlike Rittenhouse — a 17-year-old lifeguard who misled people about his age and emergency medical technician certification — Grosskreutz obtained his firearm through proper channels and was certified as an EMT.\n\nRittenhouse volunteered as an armed security guard for a Kenosha used car lot after businesses had been burned and vandalized during demonstrations the previous day. He left his post and his partner shortly before midnight and encountered Joseph Rosenbaum, who one witness described as a \"babbling idiot\" saying provocative things and shouting racial slurs at various times throughout the evening."}

The sale includes deals on firearms, optics, bags and gun parts, among other items.\n\nThe decision to promote the sale using an image of Rittenhouse was met with mixed emotions.

Rittenhouse killed two people and injured another during a protest against police brutality in Wisconsin last year.\n\nProtests have been held in several other U.S. cities nationwide over the verdict, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nAbout 1,000 people marched through downtown Chicago Saturday afternoon, organized by Black Lives Matter Chicago and other local activist groups.

(AP) — An 18-year-old Illinois teen charged with fatally shooting two people during a protest in southeastern Wisconsin last year is prohibited from associating with known white supremacists under a judge's recently modified bail conditions.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse was 17 during the Aug. 25 demonstration in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as hundreds were protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse has been charged with multiple counts, including reckless and intentional homicide, endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm.\n\nProsecutors allege Rittenhouse, who is white, left his home in Antioch, Illinois, and traveled to Kenosha to answer a call for militia to protect businesses. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic street demonstrations after a white officer shot Blake in the back during a domestic disturbance, leaving Blake paralyzed.\n\nRittenhouse opened fire with an assault-style rifle during the protest, killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, authorities said. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all counts and argued he fired in self-defense. Conservatives have rallied around him, generating enough money to make his $2 million cash bail.\n\nAccording to online court records, a Wisconsin judge modified Rittenhouse's conditions of release on Friday to note Rittenhouse \"shall not knowingly have conduct with any person or group of persons known to harm, threaten, harass or menace others on the basis of their race, beliefs on the subject of religion, color, national origin, or gender.\"\n\nHe is also barred from possessing and consuming alcohol and from having firearms.\n\nProsecutors had requested the modifications after Rittenhouse was seen drinking at a bar in the southeastern Wisconsin city of Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Milwaukee, earlier this month. The legal drinking age is 21, but in Wisconsin, Rittenhouse could legally drink alcohol because he was with his mother.\n\nAccording to WMTV, prosecutors wrote in their request that Rittenhouse also posed for a photo outside Pudgy's Pub with two men as they made the \"OK\" sign with their hands, a symbol used by white supremacists. Prosecutors also alleged five men at the tavern serenaded Rittenhouse with a song that has become the anthem of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group."}

This year marks the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims' first Thanksgiving with the indigenous population. (It's likely, however, if the Indians had known where this was going they might have suggested the Pilgrims order out.)\n\nA little more than a week ago, on November 19th, 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty by a jury of eleven white people and one person of color, of all five charges including murder, stemming from a deadly street protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25, 2020. The day before Jacob Blake, a black man, was shot four times in the back and three times on the side as he opened the driver's door to his girlfriend's SUV.\n\nAmazingly, Blake survived though he required numerous surgeries. But the white cop who fired the shots faced no charges. This led to angry protests in the streets that included considerable looting. TV coverage and social media apparently inspired Rittenhouse, then 17, to drive from Antioch, Illinois to Kenosha. Unfortunately, he was carrying his trusty assault rifle. (Despite being under age to have any gun, much less such the deadly the AR-15.)\n\nSo it was Rittenhouse killed two men and permanently paralyzed a third but claimed self defense. In what some labeled an Oscar worthy performance, in his trial testimony Rittenhouse broke down crying. It was rather odd, however, because there were no tears. (To be fair, he didn't have the benefit of tear-inducing glycerin that actors and actresses use.)\n\nKyle got an \"A\" for effort as he squeezed his face and squinted his eyes over and over hoping to open the flood gates but it only released a tiny drop. At one point he sneaked a peek at the jury to see if they were buying it.\n\n(Spoiler alert: They were!)\n\nYes, \"Kryin' Kyle\" got off scot free and is the darling of the right wing gun rights activists. Ted Nugent, the over the hill rocker, reportedly has offered to provide Rittenhouse a lifetime's worth of ammunition. (What could go wrong there?)\n\nThe history of unarmed black men being killed by white men goes back to slavery that began in this country in 1619 when 20 enslaved Africans arrived in Jamestown. But in the public eye where an unarmed black man is killed by someone who claims self defense, that may have started with George Zimmerman.\n\nOn February 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida, George Zimmerman fatally shot Travon Martin and was also found not guilty. I could list dozens, maybe hundreds of similar cases but I'm only allowed 800 words.\n\nSuch is the current case in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year old black man who went jogging and tragically he wound up dead. The three white men who were charged with his murder claimed self defense. Thankfully, they were all found guilty."}

Conviction on each count can bring a sentence of three years in prison plus three years of supervision. Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder entered a not guilty plea on Black's behalf.\n\nThe hearing had been delayed after Black switched lawyers and hired well-known Waukesha criminal defense attorney Anthony Cotton.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cotton filed a motion to dismiss the charges, which he says rely on \"misreading of the plain language\" of the law regarding minors with guns.\n\nBlack purchased the Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle for Rittenhouse — who was 17 at the time — last May at a hardware store near Black's family's property in Rusk County. Rittenhouse has said he used $1,200 in enhanced unemployment pay after his lifeguarding job was ended during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThey used the gun to shoot on private, rural land and it was being kept by Black's stepfather in Kenosha until the night of Aug. 25, when Black and Rittenhouse armed themselves before going downtown. They have said they were asked to protect a car business that had been vandalized and burned during the previous two nights of unrest in the wake of a police shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nThat night, Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 27. Rittenhouse was charged with homicides and other counts and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say the shootings were in self-defense. His trial is set for Nov. 1.\n\nWisconsin law makes it a felony for anyone who gives a firearm to someone under 18, and a more serious felony if the minor shoots and kills someone.\n\nThere are two exceptions to the first transfer prohibition — it's legal to give a minor a gun if it's used for supervised training in gun safety or supervised target practice, and it's legal if a member of the military or National Guard gives a minor a gun in the line of duty.\n\nCotton argues that there's also a requirement to trigger the general ban on minors with guns — that they must be in violation of rules for young hunters. One law applies to how and when children under 16 may possess firearms while hunting. Another requires young hunters to obtain a hunter safety education certificate.\n\nThe first could not apply because Rittenhouse was 17, Cotton argues, and the second doesn't apply because Rittenhouse wasn't hunting, and therefore wasn't in violation of doing so without a safety education certification.\n\nIn a separate motion, Cotton argues that prosecutors can't charge Black with two counts for the same transfer just because two people were killed. It violates constitutional guarantees of due process and against double jeopardy, the motion states.\n\nHe notes that, under the state's theory, if Rittenhouse had used the gun over a year and killed 12 people, Black could face 12 counts of providing the gun.\n\n\"This absurd conclusion is not supported by a common sense reading of the plain language of the statute, nor by its legislative intent,\" he wrote.\n\nThe motion says prosecutors have the burden of showing the Legislature indeed meant to provide cumulative punishments to the person whose single transfer of a firearm led to multiple deaths.\n\nSchroeder indicated he seemed to agree that the charges \"have a multiplicity problem,\" noting the two counts are identical and don't even identify the two victims."}

According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Kline was fired from the Ferguson Police Department in 2018 after being charged with stalking a woman and threatening her male companion by poking his chest with a handgun.\n\nThe criminal charges were later dropped because the couple refused to testify, the newspaper reported.\n\nKline confirmed he used to be with the Police Department.\n\n\"Jesse Kline. Prior Ferguson police Officer Jesse Kline,\" he shouted at the crowd.\n\nKline joined the Ferguson Police Department in 2015, following the shooting of Michael Brown, a Black man, by a white police officer. Brown's death, which did not result in criminal charges, sparked protests and acts of vandalism in the St. Louis suburb.\n\nKline has protested outside the Kenosha County Courthouse for the past three days, bringing a gun to the demonstration Wednesday for a brief time. Wearing a tactical vest, button-down shirt, bow tie, slacks and dress shoes, Kline spent part of the morning yelling \"Black Lives Matter is a terrorist organization\" and screaming \"(expletive) BLM!\" through a megaphone as he stood in the public way across the street from the courthouse.\n\nKenosha County sheriff's deputies told Kline, who drove to the courthouse in a Maserati with Illinois plates, that he could not have the rifle there because he was within 1,000 feet of a school if he did not have a permit.\n\n\"If you want to be here, you're going to have to put the rifle away,\" a deputy said.\n\nUnder Wisconsin law, any individual who knowingly possesses a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a school is subject to a fine up to $1,000. A sheriff's spokesman said the incident was resolved without action when he voluntarily put away his rifle.\n\nKline, who had attended the protests a day earlier with a dog, returned to the courthouse without a rifle, though he kept a sound system that blasted \"Build a B----\" by Bella Poarch and \"Ride It\" by DJ Regard, among other TikTok hits.\n\nHe returned to the courthouse Thursday with his dog, carrying a bullhorn and a long, narrow tote bag that was similar in appearance to a rifle case.\n\n\"I don't talk to the media,\" he shouted, pacing back and forth with the animal while playing rap music."}

Some media outlets finally reported on evidence that supported his self-defense claims and one critic called for \"revisiting\" the clearly biased reporting in the case.\n\nKYLE RITTENHOUSE RECOUNTS KENOSHA RIOTS, REACTS TO MEDIA PORTRAYAL OF TRIAL IN FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE ACQUITTAL\n\nHowever, there is one person whose status has not changed: Norfolk Police Officer William Kelly, who was fired for simply donating to the Rittenhouse defense fund and writing a supportive note as a private citizen. He made the comment and donation anonymously. The only thing more shocking than Kelly's loss of his job is that Norfolk City Manager Chip Filer and Police Chief Larry Boone have retained theirs.\n\nI criticized the firing of Kelly last April as a blatant attack on free speech. The termination occurred after Kelly made a $25 donation to the defense of Kyle Rittenhouse. He made the donation anonymously and added the comment \"God Bless. Thank you for your courage. Keep your head up. You've done nothing wrong. Every rank-and-file police officer supports you.\"\n\nEarly in the Rittenhouse case, activists sought to cut off Rittenhouse's ability to raise money for his defense by harassing donors and (successfully) pressuring companies like GoFundMe to block contributions.\n\nA criminal defense in any case (let alone a high-profile case with ramped up prosecution teams) is hugely expensive. That financial threat can prompt some to plead guilty. That is why people want to help fund such defenses to guarantee true access to a fair trial. Activists and GoFundMe did everything they could to block such efforts and increase the pressure on this teenager to just plead guilty.\n\nBack to Kelly. This is an officer who had served for almost 20 years when he contributed to the defense. As a police officer, Kelly likely saw the defense grounds more clearly than most people. The jury ultimately agreed with his view that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense.\n\nNevertheless, activists learned his identity and demanded his termination. City Manager Filer rushed to satisfy the mob. He fired Kelly with the support of Police Chief Boone and declared \"his egregious comments erode the trust between the Norfolk Police Department and those they are sworn to serve.\"\n\nKeep in mind the \"egregious comments,\" that there are officers who support Rittenhouse and believe in his defense, were said anonymously. Kelly has pointed out that Boone was allowed in uniform to publicly march with Black Lives Matter protesters. Yet, he was fired for anonymously making a supportive donation and a statement to a legal defense fund.\n\nVarious public officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have contributed to the The Minnesota Freedom Fund, which \"pays criminal bail and immigration bonds for those who cannot otherwise afford to as we seek to end discriminatory, coercive, and oppressive jailing.\"\n\nThe vice president and others have the right to support such legal defense funds, which aim to ensure litigants have the means to defend themselves. So does Kelly.\n\nWhen Kelly was fired, many on the left celebrated despite the fact that he was being denied his rights to free speech and free association. It is a pattern I have written about in the past as public employees are fired for statements on social media or associations in their private lives.\n\nThis includes a New Jersey police officer fired for calling BLM protesters \"terrorists\" on her personal Facebook account. Most recently, a court reinstated Loudoun teacher Byron \"Tanner\" Cross, who was fired for speaking publicly against gender identification policies.\n\nAs it stands, Kelly was fired for supporting (again, anonymously) a teenager who was ultimately acquitted of all charges by a jury. He was fired for contributing to a legal fund that would help the accused put on a full defense. That is in the interest of justice.\n\nYet, Filer and Boone remain employed despite using their official positions to retaliate against a public employee using his constitutional right to free speech. Kelly and his family continue to appeal his firing as they struggle to survive on the teacher's salary of his wife.\n\nThe dictator Idi Amin once proclaimed \"There is freedom of speech, but I cannot guarantee freedom after speech.\" That seems the standard applied in Norfolk, where even anonymous support for a legal defense is grounds for termination."}

The judge set November 1 as the new date to begin the trial, with a May 17 status hearing.\n\nRittenhouse faces multiple felony counts, including reckless homicide and reckless endangerment. He also faces a misdemeanour count of being a minor in possession of a firearm.\n\nRittenhouse appeared with his lawyer during the court hearing broadcast over Zoom. He spoke only when the judge asked him if he had any problem with the delay, which would push his trial start to more than a year after the shootings.\n\n\"No, your honour,\" Rittenhouse said. He was seated behind his lawyer, wearing a mask. The judge cautioned that the trial could be pushed even further, saying the November date was \"not written in stone\".\n\nAssistant District Attorney Thomas Binger said both sides needed more time, citing a \"number of outstanding issues\", including DNA testing.\n\nRittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, agreed to the November trial start.\n\n\"We're interested in moving this matter forward but whatever the court decides, we'll abide by,\" he said.\n\nLegal reckoning\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Rittenhouse, who is white, travelled to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, on August 25 after a local militia posted an online message seeking help protecting businesses from protesters. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic protests after a white police officer shot Jacob Blake, who is Black, in the back during a domestic disturbance. The shooting left Blake paralysed from the waist down.\n\nRittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, opened fire on protesters Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz with an AR-15-style rifle. Rosenbaum and Huber died, while Grosskreutz survived with wounds.\n\nGrosskreutz and his lawyer also attended the hearing but did not speak.\n\nRittenhouse has argued that he fired in self-defence after the three protesters attacked him. Police let him walk through their lines in the moments following the shootings, even though Rittenhouse still had his rifle slung over his shoulder and protesters were screaming that he had just shot three people.\n\nConservatives have rallied around him, painting him as a symbol for gun rights. They generated $2m for his bail in November.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters have worked to define him as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Richards told Schroeder last month that Rittenhouse has received threats and has moved into an undisclosed safe house.\n\nThe delay comes as courts begin to deal with the legal ramifications of the BLM movement.\n\nJury selection began on Monday in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFloyd's death, which occurred while Chauvin's knee was on his neck, sparked national protests.\n\nThe trial of Andrea Sahouri, an Iowa journalist arrested while covering the protests and charged with failure to disperse and interfering with official acts, also began on Monday.\n\nKenneth Walker, Breonna Taylor's boyfriend at the time of her death, was cleared of all charges related to the shooting of a police officer during the botched raid that killed Taylor, also on Monday.\n\nTaylor's name, along with Floyd's and others, were mentioned at BLM protests during the summer."}

(CBS 58) -- A group of Democrats want to update the state's gun laws for minors which supporters say could fix a \"loophole\" that could have prevented Kyle Rittenhouse from carrying a semiautomatic rifle during last year's unrest in Kenosha.\n\nThe bill introduced by Democrats from Kenosha would only allow minors to possess a long gun or long barrel rifle if they are legally hunting. Under current law, there's an exception which allows a minor to possess a long gun or rifle if the barrel is longer than 16 inches.\n\nThe proposal comes weeks after a jury found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all five charges he faced. During the trail, the defense argued the AR-15 firearm Rittenhouse had the night of the shooting did not fit the definition of a short-barreled shotgun under state statute.\n\nThis resulted in Judge Bruce Schroeder dropping Rittenhouse's underage gun possession charge.\n\nState Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said the proposal to clarify state law is necessary to prevent minors from \"roaming the streets\" with long guns.\n\n\"This clarifies if you are hunting that's fine, that's the intent of the law,\" Larson said. \"But to say that someone is out when there is a curfew in place, basically going around taunting people with a gun and saying that's acceptable is pretty ridiculous.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers have long resisted reforming Wisconsin's gun laws because they fear the measures would take guns away from law abiding citizens, arguing it infringes on their second amendment rights.\n\nState Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) is concerned the bill could impact students who participate in school rifle clubs.\n\n\"You could potentially rule out a number of schools that have school sports teams where if they are going out to shoot at clay pigeons and they probably wouldn't be able to carry their shotguns or long guns,\" said Testin.\n\nOne of the bill sponsors, Rep. Tod Ohnstad (D-Kenosha), said the proposal would simply clarify the intent of the law passed decades ago that allows minors to hunt.\n\n\"This bill does the same; however, it just doesn't allow them to carry AR-15's or other long rifles on our streets,\" Ohnstad said in a statement. \"This is a dangerous loophole and it must be clarified.\"\n\nGun Safety Bills\n\nThis week, Democrats also introduced a package of bills called the \"Safe Storage of Gun Safety.\"\n\nSome proposals include requiring businesses that sell guns to secure all firearms when the business is unattended, giving customers a secure lockable container or trigger lock for the gun during purchase, and creating a reporting system for lost or stolen guns which would have to be reported within 24 hours.\n\n\"Gun violence and accidental shootings continue to pose serious public health and public safety risks,\" said Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison). \"To make our communities safer, the 'Safe Storage for Gun Safety' plan would prevent gun violence and accidental deaths by keeping firearms out of those who simply should not have them.\"\n\nRepublican leaders are unlikely to support the measures due to their resistance on similar proposals introduced in years past.\n\nThe range of bills come as President Joe Biden and Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers have attempted to tighten gun control laws such as implementing universal background checks and so-called 'red flag' laws that allow a judge to take away guns from those who might be a dangerous to themselves or others.\n\n\"Any attempt to water down the second amendment is going to have issues in my perspective,\" Testin said."}

To call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement,' he declared, repeating a false claim that anyone with even passing familiarity with the case would know.\n\nRittenhouse did not cross state lines with a weapon. This falsehood was refuted by Illinois county officials in October 2020 and by courtroom testimony.\n\nDe Blasio seemed to excuse his ignorance by tweeting: 'The far-right trolls who think it makes a difference whether a violent gunman got his weapon before or after he crossed state lines are missing the point: two people are dead and their killer is left unaccountable. That's not justice and they know it.'\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, also misinformed his nearly 500,000 followers.\n\nNadler tweeted, 'This heartbreaking verdict is a miscarriage of justice and sets a dangerous precedent which justifies federal review by DOJ.

And he made prosecutors provide addresses for about 27 witnesses that might actually be called, after they first submitted a witness list of 175 people.\n\nAt a hearing, which ran more than two hours, Schroeder said he would hold a separate pre-trial hearing next month about whether he'll allow testimony from use-of-force experts that both sides have indicated they want to call.\n\nThe trial itself remains set for Nov. 1.\n\nRittenhouse, now 18, is charged with fatally shooting two people and wounding a third — along with other lesser offenses — during violent protests in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020 after the police shooting of Jacob Blake. His lawyer says he acted in self defense.\n\nThe prosecution did reveal Friday that it has infrared video from an FBI airplane that they say shows Rittenhouse was chasing his first victim, Joseph Rosenbaum, and said something to him before Rosenbaum then chased him, leading to the fatal encounter seconds later. The defense said it is obtaining the same video soon.\n\nAlso left undecided Friday was whether the estimated 150 or so people who will be summoned as possible jurors will be asked to fill out extensive questionnaires before the selection process begins.\n\nSchroeder, Wisconsin's longest serving sitting judge, said he disfavors questionnaires, and expressed concern it would tip recipients off that they could serve in the high-profile Rittenhouse trial — and might prompt even more talk about the case than has already been occurring in town.\n\nHe said someone even approached him in a grocery store and said they'd love to serve on the Rittenhouse jury, adding: \"Of course, that person will not.\"\n\nSchroeder said he's concerned about some of the questions lawyers have proposed concerning issues like support for certain political movements, guns, or memberships.\n\n\"This is not and won't be a political trial,\" he said.\n\nBut both sides urged him to use a questionnaire, to speed jury selection and help screen out people with the most strongly held views before they \"contaminate\" other potential jurors during traditional voir dire, where people in a group answer questions from lawyers in person.\n\nSchroeder seemed confident a jury could be selected in one day, without a questionnaire ahead of time, but said he'd revisit the matter and decide next week whether one — with limited queries — could be sent out.\n\nJudge rejects evidence on 'prior acts'\n\nAssistant District Attorney Thomas Binger argued repeatedly that three incidents involving Rittenhouse go \"to what I posit strong theory of case — that he's essentially a teen vigilante involving himself in things that don't concern him.\"\n\nOne video shows Rittenhouse striking a girl who was fighting with his sister in June 2020. One from Aug. 15, 2020 shows him and a friend watching from inside a car as people — whom Rittenhouse believes are looters — leave a CVS store across the street, while Rittenhouse says he wished he had his rifle so he could shoot at them. The still photos are of Rittenhouse posing with members of the Proud Boys at a Racine County tavern after a hearing in his case in January.\n\nBinger said he expects the defense to portray Rittenhouse as a community-minded altruist, so jurors need to hear about his other state of mind. \"It helps illuminate the truth for the jury,\" he said."}

And if I were among the residents Republicans are targeting, which I'm comfortably not, I'd find it insulting that my elected officials think speaking to the tribal instinct in me is a sufficient enough campaign strategy to secure re-election.\n\nIt's why a predator like Brock Turner, the Stanford University athlete who was convicted of sexually assaulting a young woman behind a dumpster, can garner empathy from the trial judge in his case. \"A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him,\" said Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky, adding that he didn't believe Turner would be \"a danger to others\" — even though he already had been.\n\nIt's why an 18-year-old white male like Rittenhouse can drive from one city to another, be armed for a fight, kill two people, injure another, and be treated like a prodigal son who made an honest mistake in an act of mere self-defense. Over the course of the trial, as the court disallowed words of empathy for the shooting victims and offered space for a tearful killer to plead his case, I've been reminded of how willing our nation is to offer the benefit of the doubt to some while clanking a prison-cell door and throwing away the key for others. Rittenhouse was acquitted on all charges by a 12-person jury on Nov. 19.\n\nAcross the board, active biases like these are easy to spot but hard to tackle. According to Iliana Pujols, policy director with the Connecticut Justice Alliance (CTJA), that's partly because battles over ideological rhetoric are hard to win.\n\n\"It's a really hard fight because we're up against racist ideas,\" she said. \"Not just actions.\"\n\n\"I think this is a perfect time to compare the issues we're seeing in Connecticut to Kenosha,\" Pujols said, \"because it's an empathy issue. The Republican Party doesn't know where these kids are coming from. They can't relate to them.\"\n\nAfter hosting a number of focus groups they call \"vision sessions\" in West Hartford to shine a light on issues impacting urban youth, Pujols said it's clear that those with privilege or in power are making decisions based on a lack of information and predisposed beliefs about youth from places like Waterbury, Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport.\n\n\"Everyone's eager to invest in crime prevention now, but that's only because the problem, small as it may be, is coming into their neighborhoods,\" she said.\n\nThat thin border between the inner city and the suburb is often highly policed to ensure there isn't crime creeping into places where it \"doesn't belong.\" Policies to beat city crimes back into the downtown area or low-income neighborhoods are all erected in the spirit of security theater, suggesting that as long as the families with the largest lawns feel safe, that's a job well done."}

Now that he has been found not guilty, however, he can accept those funds.\n\n\"If someone is acquitted of those charges, as Rittenhouse was today, a fundraiser started subsequently for their legal defense and other expenses would not violate this policy,\" the GoFundMe post read. \"A fundraiser to pay lawyers, cover legal expenses or to help with ongoing living expenses for a person acquitted of those charges could remain active as long as we determine it is not in violation of any of our other terms and, for example, the purpose is clearly stated and the correct beneficiary is added to the fundraiser.\"\n\nThe implication, which has been seized upon on Twitter, is that if someone is convicted of a violent crime, then GoFundMe cannot solicit or raise funds for that person. Of course, people are often wrongly convicted, and those same people are the ones most in need of fundraising to pay exorbitant court and legal costs.\n\nIn response to the backlash, GoFundMe turned off replies to its tweet on the subject.\n\n\"We constantly evaluate and evolve our Terms of Service and consider new factors that keep emerging in today's world,\" the Medium post read. \"We care deeply about human rights and have written terms to address this — we do not allow fundraisers that support hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination; or involves weaponry.\" So there's that."}

Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest,\" Nadler wrote in a tweet posted Friday afternoon.\n\nCan Kyle Rittenhouse face federal charges?\n\nIn order for Rittenhouse to face federal charges, there are several complicated factors that could make it unlikely for federal prosecutors to pursue a case.\n\nFor most homicide cases, federal law typically only applies in crimes that specifically violate federal law. According to Shouse Law Group, a criminal justice team in Los Angeles, the crime of murder \"is prosecuted in state courts as a state crime. But murder becomes a federal crime when it occurs in violation of federal law, or when it takes place on a federal land or territory.\"\n\nShouse Law Group writes, \"The federal crime of murder is defined as the 'unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.' In general, there are seven scenarios when an unlawful killing violates the laws of the federal government.\"\n\nAccording to the law group, these include when:\n\nthe murder is of a federal judge or a federal law enforcement official\n\nthe killing is of an immediate family member of a federal law enforcement official\n\nthe murder is of an elected or appointed federal official\n\nthe killing is committed during a bank robbery\n\nthe killing takes place aboard a ship at sea that is engaged in interstate commerce per the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution\n\nthe murder was designed to influence a court case\n\nthe killing takes place on federal property\n\nRittenhouse was not accused of a hate crime and because he is not a member of law enforcement, he cannot be charged with depriving anyone of their civil rights as a federal agent. Rittenhouse was also not accused of a robbery on federal property or involving a federal business.\n\nThe charges Rittenhouse was facing became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial justice in the country."}

Richards wrote that Rosenbaum started the altercation with Rittenhouse in hopes of making off with his assault-style rifle, which only bolsters Rittenhouse's self-defense argument.\n\nKimberley Motley, an attorney representing Rosenbaum's estate, rejected Richards' theory but declined to comment further since the case against Rittenhouse remains open.\n\n\"We believe strongly that Mr. Rittenhouse was the aggressor and his actions were not lawful,\" she said in a phone interview Tuesday.\n\nRichards also filed a motion to dismiss a charge that Rittenhouse couldn't possess a gun because he was too young under Wisconsin law, arguing that statutes prohibit minors from possessing short-barreled shotguns and rifles, and Rittenhouse's assault-style rifle doesn't meet that definition.\n\nFact Check: What's true, what's not in the Kenosha shootings involving Jacob Blake, Kyle Rittenhouse\n\nRittenhouse, who is white, traveled to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, on Aug. 25 to answer a call from local militia to protect businesses from protesters.

According to prosecutors, Rittenhouse opened fire on Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz. He killed Rosenbaum and Huber. Grosskreutz was hit but survived.\n\nRittenhouse was 17 years old at the time. Now 18, he maintains he fired in self-defense but prosecutors have charged him with a litany of counts, including reckless homicide, recklessly endangering safety, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and being a minor in possession of a dangerous weapon.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supports have painted him as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives have made him into a symbol for gun rights, generating $2 million for his bail. His trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 1.\n\nProsecutors filed motions last week asking a judge to allow a video from July 2020 which they said shows Rittenhouse striking a teenage girl in the back on Kenosha's waterfront. They also want to argue that Rittenhouse is affiliated with the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group.\n\nPhotos taken in January show Rittenhouse drinking in a Mount Pleasant bar and gesturing with what appeared to be a white power symbol. Prosecutors said in their motions they have learned the people Rittenhouse was with included the leader of the Proud Boys' Wisconsin chapter and several of its high-ranking members."}

The rest was simply a false narrative pushed by an irresponsible media.\n\nNo evidence existed that Rittenhouse believed in the superiority of the white race and as was the case with Loudon County Virginia parents (complaining to their school board over CRT instruction and same-sex bathrooms) there equally was zero evidence to label Mr. Rittenhouse a domestic terrorist.\n\nMoreover, he did not carry a rifle across state lines and it was not illegal for him to possess that rifle under Wisconsin Law which is made infinitely clear by photos, post verdict, of a 16 year old black female carrying a similar rifle in Kenosha while providing security for those protesting the Rittenhouse verdict."}

Black testified that video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse and reaching for the teenager's gun, Huber attacking Rittenhouse with a skateboard and trying to wrestle away his gun, and Grosskreutz running at him with a pistol in his hand.\n\n\"A citizen in that position, given those indicators, would it be reasonable for them to believe they were about to be assaulted?\" Black said. \"I would argue yes.\"\n\nRittenhouse was 17 years old when he made the short trip from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha on the night of Aug. 25, 2020, in response to a call from a Kenosha militia to help protect businesses from protesters. The city was in the throes of several nights of chaotic demonstrations sparked by a white police officer's decision to shoot Jacob Blake, a Black man, during a domestic disturbance. The shooting left Blake paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nShortly before midnight, Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle in the parking lot of a used car dealership, killing him. Moments later, he shot Huber in the street, killing him as well. Seconds after shooting Huber he shot Grosskreutz, wounding him in the arm.\n\nProsecutors have charged Rittenhouse with multiple counts, including homicide, attempted homicide and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Rittenhouse's attorneys say he fired in self-defense. His trial is slated to begin Nov. 1.\n\nRittenhouse's lead attorney, Mark Richards, is trying to persuade Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder to let Black testify at the trial. Schroeder allowed Black to speak at the hearing via Zoom in hopes that would help him make a decision.\n\nBlack testified that he studied bystander video of the three shootings extensively.

Anyone who watched the actual trial live would have understood that the case was far narrower and that the only issue was whether Rittenhouse reasonably feared for his life during the moments before he fired the shots that killed two men and wounded a third.\n\nHad he been tried for the prosecution's version of the crime, I would have judged him morally guilty. He never should have gone to Kenosha. He never should have armed himself. And he never should have gotten into a situation where he might have to use lethal force in self-defense.\n\nBut those were not the charges. And, indeed, they could not be the charges, because his actions – morally wrong as they may have been – were protected by the First and Second Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHad I been on this jury, I would have found him not guilty because the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not act in self-defense.

That'll take years to compile. And studies on defendant testimony are few and far between.\n\nOne study of over 300 criminal trials published in the Cornell Law Review in 2009 found that some 77% of defendants who testified were found guilty. Among the defendants who chose not to testify, around 72% were convicted.\n\nA 1950s study by Harry Kalven and Hans Zeisel found that defendants without criminal records testified over 90% of the time and those with criminal histories testified around 70% of the time.\n\nDefendants with records are more reluctant to testify out of fear it'll enable prosecutors to expose the extent of their criminal pasts to jurors. The high-profile defendants who testified recently had no criminal records or minimal ones.\n\nWHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE RECENT DECISIONS TO TESTIFY?\n\nBoth Rittenhouse and McMichael claimed self-defense, so their states of mind during the shootings were central to their trials. They had little choice but to testify since only they could tell jurors what they were thinking and feeling.\n\nRittenhouse conveyed that he feared for his life, breaking down on the stand as he described a protester he fatally shot charging at him. McMichael told jurors he was forced to open fire, alleging Arbery attacked him and grabbed his shotgun.\n\nAlthough it wasn't as crucial to their trials, Holmes and Potter also testified about their states of mind."}

The shooting left Blake partially paralyzed.\n\nA jury on Friday found Rittenhouse not guilty of first-degree reckless homicide for killing Joseph Rosenbaum, 36; first-degree intentional homicide for killing Anthony Huber, 26; and attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the shooting of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28. He was also found not guilty of two first-degree recklessly endangering safety counts.\n\n\"Anthony and Jojo, they didn't get justice yesterday,\" said Mariah Smith, of the Peoples Revolution, referring to Rosenbaum's nickname.\n\nBlack people, Smith, 29, said, have long heard the refrain that their lives don't matter, but the Rittenhouse verdict signals that refrain applies to whites who stand in the struggle for Black liberation.\n\n\"They've been saying Black lives don't matter but understand that if you stand with Black folks yours don't either,\" Smith said. \"Understand in the world there is a public enemy number one and it is Black folks and if you stand with the public enemy you are public enemy as well. For them to come out and to stand with us and they lost their lives speak volumes, and I feel like that should speak to America.\"\n\nSmith was among the speakers at Saturday's march and rally sponsored by the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression. The marchers made their way along State Street before ending at the Federal Courthouse, 517 E. Wisconsin Ave, where Smith and others spoke on the courthouse steps.\n\nAlong the route, marchers chanted protest slogans including \"No Justice No Peace No Racist Police\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" In front of the courthouse, a man dressed in a black hoodie with 16 small circles drawn on the back representing bullet holes laid on the grown. Those gathered, raised their fists in a moment of silence for Huber and Rosenbaum.\n\nOmar Flores, the alliance co-chair, was angry about the verdict but is motivated more than ever about continuing the work of his organization. The group has been organizing for civilian control of the police.\n\n\"We want people to not just be angry, we want people to be organized,\" said Flores, who grew up in Kenosha. \"It is not going to get done passively. We have to put in the work.\"\n\nStanding among the marchers was retired minister Dale Stohre of Franklin. The 75-year-old former United Church of Christ minister stood holding a sign reading \"I am still calling for justice.\"\n\nWhen he heard the verdict, the word \"grief\" came to mind.\n\n\"Nobody won,\" said Stohre, who attended the event with his wife. \"Even Kyle Rittenhouse is scarred for life. He may never be the person that he could have been because of what he did and what happened to him since then. Not to mention the families of the victims. I grieve for Kenosha. It is a town in pain right now.\"\n\nMilwaukee resident Nathaniel Haack was like many who expected the outcome but was still disappointed by it. For him, the verdict has far-reaching consequences for the future of protests.\n\n\"The message that has been received is that protesters are fair game to be hunted,\" said the 33-year-old, who brought his 6-year-old daughter to the rally and march. \"That is terrifying for democracy no matter what your political opinions are. Everyone's political opinions should be able to be shared peacefully without fear of violence. It's really that simple.\""}

Rittenhouse faced five charges and was found not guilty on all of them.\n\n\"Ha, let the boy be black and it would've been life...hell he would've had his life taken before the bullshit trial.. sad,\" Wallace said in a tweet shortly after the verdict.\n\nRittenhouse's trial has divided the country, largely along partisan lines, with conservatives praising the jury's decision and liberals condemning the decision.\n\n\"Today's verdict means there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son. It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,\" Karen Bloom and John Huber, the parents of Anthony Huber, who was killed by Rittenhouse, said in a statement.\n\n\"We hope that decent people will join us in forcefully rejecting that message and demanding more of our laws, our officials, and our justice system,\" they added.\n\nConcerns of violent protests erupting have swirled as people for and against Kyle Rittenhouse have been at a standoff outside the courtroom for days while the trial proceeded.\n\n\"I believe justice has been served in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial.

The protesters called for justice for Chrystul Kizer, a sex trafficking victim who is accused of killing her abuser when she was 17 years old.\n\nDuring a rally in Civic Center Park and a march through the downtown area, demonstrators chanted Kizer's name in the same breath as the names of the three men Rittenhouse shot, two fatally.\n\n\"We've seen that Rittenhouse can get away with premeditated murder.

Meyn says this line of questioning was one of the few times the prosecution made up some ground, but it took too long to get to those questions and by then Binger may have lost the attention of the jury.\n\n\"I didn't understand where the prosecutor was going with his cross,\" Meyn, who has worked for the Wisconsin State Public Defender and the Wisconsin Innocence Project, says. \"There should be no guessing. The general rule in cross-examination is, either you know the answer or don't care what the answer is. I felt that rule was not being followed. There was always one question too many, even if the prosecution sort of made a point, he asked that one additional question to further explain what he meant. By the time they got to what I thought was their most effective cross-examination of the day, it was the very end of the day. By that time you might have lost half the jury. To lose half the jury during a cross-examination of the defendant himself is a problem.\"\n\nBinger started his cross-examination by asking about events much earlier in the night and occasionally took tangents into topics such as Rittenhouse's video game preferences or the fact that he ignored the citywide curfew in Kenosha that night.\n\n\"If that's what you're basing your murder charge on, then you have big problems,\" Meyn said. \"I don't know what that was supposed to accomplish except sympathy for the defendant. The optics for the prosecution would be terrible, the last thing they want to emphasize is that it's a kid.\"\n\n\"They started with the curfew, oh my gosh,\" he adds. \"You have a murder case and you're talking about a curfew violation first? Who cares if someone's not supposed to be there, what does it have to do with intentional homicide?\"\n\nInstead of focusing on video games or curfew violations, Meyn says he would have focused more on why Rittenhouse thought his life was threatened and how he could claim that he himself wasn't a threat to Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz, his victims.\n\n\"I would have gone through each of these things, these people aren't related, aren't together, aren't in a gang, none of them know each other,\" Meyn says, \"That should be the emphasis of the cross. You shot three people in three minutes. You describe a mob, no one here knew each other. These incidents had space between them. And then the first two didn't have a weapon.\"\n\n\"How strong does that get after he shoots someone, after he's running down the street with an AR-15?\" he continues. \"That is a threat. I would've focused on Grosskreutz, when you saw him with a gun he became a threat, yes? So it's OK that you — it's reasonable when you see someone with a gun [to view them as a threat] but not when he sees someone with a gun?\"\n\nThe decision over whether or not a defendant should testify is always a risky one for the defense, but according to Meyn it mostly paid off for Rittenhouse.\n\n\"Rittenhouse as a witness did phenomenal,\" he says. \"[He] maintained control of his narrative during the entirety of cross. Never waivered, regardless how many times he was asked to admit x, y or z. That's extraordinary.\""}

If administrators were doing their jobs, faculty and students would freely air a wide variety of viewpoints and have opportunities to better understand one another's diverse perspectives. Instead, many administrators are preemptively imposing their preferred narratives.\n\nThe Rittenhouse saga began in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25, amid rioting that followed the police shooting of a Black man. Rittenhouse, then 17, armed himself with an AR-15-style rifle and walked into the chaos, claiming that he intended to protect the community. He wound up shooting three men, killing two. Last week, a Wisconsin jury found him not guilty of murder, crediting his claim that, at the moment he fired, he feared for his life and acted in self-defense. This, many analysts argued, was a plausible conclusion to draw from Wisconsin law and video footage and testimony presented at trial.\n\nAdam Serwer: Of course Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted\n\nMore than 2,000 miles away, administrators at UC Santa Cruz felt otherwise. Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Interim Chief Diversity Officer Judith Estrada issued a statement that began like this:\n\nWe are disheartened and dismayed by this morning's not guilty verdict on all charges in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse ... We join in solidarity with all who are outraged by this failure of accountability.\n\nUC Santa Cruz is a public institution with roughly 19,000 students and 1,000 instructors who, one can safely say, do not all share the same viewpoints. But Larive and Estrada emphasized their personal feelings and openly pledged solidarity (meaning \"unity or agreement of feeling or action,\" by one definition) with others based on whether they too feel angry. This is posturing, not engagement with a campus community. I wrote to Larive and asked her to clarify why the jury should have found Rittenhouse guilty, if that's what she meant by \"failure of accountability.\" A university spokesperson, Scott Hernandez-Jason, responded, \"The campus message speaks for itself.\"\n\nIndeed, it does. America has never known a time without sensational murder trials that seize the public's attention and inflame passions. I have an old-fashioned answer to how a university should behave in these cases: It should stay neutral and promote reasoned analysis and debate. But Larive and Estrada made a different choice. And they aren't the only university leaders who have done so in the days since the verdict. Rather than encourage independent scrutiny, administrators on many campuses have issued statements that presuppose answers to hotly contested questions, and assert opinions about the not-guilty verdict in the case and its ostensible significance as though they were matters of community consensus."}

Jerry Nadler, D-New York, called the outcome \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest,\" he wrote.\n\nPart of that statement -- the claim Rittenhouse was armed when he crossed state lines -- was repeated by many in the wake of the verdict.\n\nBut that information is wrong.\n\nTweet vs. reality\n\nWhen asked for backup, Nadler spokesperson Dan Rubin said the tweet was trying to make the point that Rittenhouse could be open to further review by the U.S. Department of Justice because he crossed state lines to be in Wisconsin for the protests.\n\nThe tweet, Rubin said, wasn't meant to convey that Rittenhouse had taken the gun itself over state lines, arguing that the situation \"at least opens up the possibility of a broader review from DOJ.\"\n\nBut that's not what the tweet says. It suggests Rittenhouse brought the gun to Wisconsin, when testimony said he did not.\n\n(To be sure, there was plenty of controversy around the fact he had a gun, and Rittenhouse initially faced a misdemeanor charge of unlawfully possessing the gun as a minor. Under Wisconsin law, anyone under 18 who possesses a dangerous weapon is guilty of a misdemeanor, unless they fall under an exception, such as for hunting. For months, Rittenhouse's attorneys pointed to one of those exceptions that they argued allows 16- and 17-year-olds to carry rifles and shotguns as long as they are not unlawfully short-barreled. Prosecutors acknowledged the gun was not short-barreled, after which the judge tossed the charge.)\n\nDuring the trial, Dominick Black, a close friend, testified that he agreed to purchase the gun for Rittenhouse, according to a Nov. 2, 2021 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report.\n\nBlack used money Rittenhouse gave him to make the purchase in Wisconsin, knowing the purchase was illegal. Rittenhouse and Black agreed that Rittenhouse wouldn't get the gun himself until he turned 18.\n\nRittenhouse did shoot the weapon several times the weekend it was purchased while up north at Black's family hunting property in May 2020, the Journal Sentinel report said.\n\nBlack testified that normally, the AR-15 was stored in Black's home in Kenosha, locked up in a gun safe. The safe could only be opened by Black's stepfather. But the night of the unrest, the guns were taken out of the safe and into the basement.\n\nSome time after Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020, he retrieved the gun from Black's basement and went into the downtown area.\n\n(A final note: Now that Rittenhouse has been acquitted, Black is asking that charges against him related to buying the gun be thrown out. A decision on that has been delayed.)\n\nOur ruling\n\nLike many others, Nadler said in a tweet following Rittenhouse's acquittal that the teen had traveled across state lines with a firearm."}

Though it's common for courtrooms to use a lottery-type system to draw jurors or alternate jurors, it's often the courtroom clerk who physically draws the jurors' numbers.\n\n\"I am now reading about how bizarre and unusual it was to have the defendant pick numbers out of the tumbler yesterday,\" Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder said Wednesday, adding that he has made it standard practice to do so since a trial he oversaw in Racine, Wisconsin, roughly 20 years ago.\n\nSchroeder said the defendant in the Racine case was Black, and there was only one Black person in the pool of 13 jurors. He said when the clerk or government official drew the alternate, it happened to be the lone Black juror.\n\n\"There was nothing wrong with it — it was all okay, but what do they talk about? Optics nowadays? Is that the word for things? It was a bad optic, I thought,\" Schroeder said. \"I think people feel better when they have control, so ever since that case, I've had an almost universal policy of having the defendant do the picks.\"\n\nSchroeder noted that he'd never received a complaint about the practice — nor did he receive any pushback from the prosecutors or defense attorneys when he allowed Rittenhouse to draw the jurors. He suggested that some viewers of the trial — which has been streamed live in its entirety — were simply using the incident as an excuse to cast doubt on the eventual verdict.\n\n\"Some people seem to be dissatisfied with that. People who want to undermine the result of the trial,\" Schroeder said.\n\nRittenhouse is charged with killing two men and injuring a third amid civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August 2020.\n\nRittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming he shot all three men in self-defense after they attacked him.\n\nSchroeder's remarks on Wednesday came amid a discussion about a note from the jury requesting to see certain videos that were played during the trial. Schroeder began discussing various complaints he'd read in the media about his decisions, including his decision to bar people from using the word \"victims\" to describe the men Rittenhouse shot — a standard rule upheld in courtrooms across the country."}

There have been 48 shootings this year on K-12 campuses, 32 of them since August 1.\n\nHere's what we know about Tuesday's shooting:\n\nHow the incident unfolded\n\nDeputies were dispatched to the school at 12:52 p.m., Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said, noting more than 100 911 calls were placed.\n\nAs police were swarming the campus, students and staff began barricading doors and hiding in classrooms.\n\nLaw enforcement officers quickly entered the building and had the suspect in custody within three minutes of their arrival, the sheriff said.\n\nOnce the suspect encountered the officers, he put his hands up and they took a gun from him before placing him in custody.\n\nThe weapon deputies said was used in the shooting, a 9 mm Sig Sauer SP2022 semiautomatic pistol, was purchased by the suspect's father on Friday, four days before the shootings at the school, Bouchard said.\n\nThree 15-round magazines were found at the scene, and the gun had seven rounds of ammunition, Bouchard said. Investigators recovered more than 30 shell casings, said the sheriff.\n\n\"We believe he fired at least 30 shots,\" he said.\n\nThe suspect had 18 rounds left, with seven in his pocket, Bouchard said.\n\n\"With this much ammunition still with him ... the quick actions of the school and the lockdown as well as the deputies going to the danger, saved lives,\" Bouchard said.\n\nAn Oakland County sheriff's deputy assigned to the school helped take the suspect into custody, Undersheriff Michael McCabe said.\n\nInvestigators believe no other weapons were involved, and there's no indication the suspect was wearing body armor.\n\nNo shots were fired by responding law enforcement, and the suspect was not injured, McCabe said.\n\nWhat we know about the victims\n\nThe four who died were Madisyn Baldwin, 17, Tate Myre, 16, Hana St. Juliana, 14, and Justin Shilling, 17, officials said. Tate died in a patrol car as a deputy was rushing him to a hospital, Bouchard said. Justin died Wednesday morning, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nSeven others – six students and a teacher – were also shot, Bouchard said.\n\nAmong the wounded were a 14-year-old girl who initially was on a ventilator following surgery, but was off the ventilator and in stable condition Wednesday, officials said. A 14-year-old boy also had a gunshot wound to the jaw and head. The teacher, a 15-year-old and 17-year-old boy were discharged, Bouchard said Wednesday.\n\nWhat we know about the suspect\n\nThe suspect is Ethan Crumbley, 15, a sophomore at the school, authorities said. He is being held at the Oakland County Jail.\n\nOakland County Prosecutor Karen D. McDonald said the suspect has been charged with the following:\n\none count of terrorism causing death\n\nfour counts of first-degree murder\n\nseven counts of assault with intent to murder\n\n12 counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.\n\nMichigan law prevents police from talking to a juvenile without parental permission, and the suspect's parents have refused that permission and requested a lawyer, Bouchard said.\n\n\"It is possible there could be additional charges\" when the investigation is complete, McDonald said.\n\nEthan Crumbley's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter and were initially scheduled to be arraigned Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Crumbleys were considered fugitives after missing their court hearing.

(AP) — A 15-year-old boy was charged with murder and terrorism for a shooting that killed four fellow students and injured more at a Michigan high school, authorities said Wednesday as they revealed additional details, including a meeting between troubled officials and his parents just a few hours before the bloodshed.\n\nNo motive was offered by Oakland County authorities, a day after violence at Oxford High School, roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit. But prosecutor Karen McDonald said the shooting was premeditated, based on a \"mountain of digital evidence\" against Ethan Crumbley.\n\n\"This was not just an impulsive act,\" McDonald said.\n\nIndeed, sheriff's Lt. Tim Willis told a judge that Crumbley recorded a video the night before the violence in which he discussed killing students.\n\nCrumbley was charged as an adult with two dozen crimes, including murder, attempted murder and terrorism causing death. During his arraignment, he replied, \"Yes, I do,\" when asked if he understood the charges. Defense attorney Scott Kozak entered a plea of not guilty.\n\n\"He deliberately brought the handgun that day with the intent to murder as many students as he could,\" assistant prosecutor Marc Keast said in successfully arguing for no bail for Crumbley and a transfer to jail from a juvenile facility.\n\nEarlier, Sheriff Mike Bouchard told reporters that Crumbley's parents were called to the school Tuesday \"for behavior in the classroom that was concerning.\" The teen remained in school, and the shooting occurred a few hours later.\n\nBouchard didn't disclose what had worried school officials. He said investigators believe the gun was already in school.\n\n\"There is nothing that he could have faced that would warrant senseless, absolutely brutal violence on other kids,\" the sheriff said, noting that Crumbley had an additional 18 rounds of ammunition when he was arrested.\n\nIn court, Keast said Crumbley entered a bathroom with a backpack and came out with a semi-automatic handgun, firing at students while moving down the hallway. The four students who were killed were 16-year-old Tate Myre, 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, 17-year-old Madisyn Baldwin and 17-year-old Justin Shilling.\n\nDeputies rushed to the school around lunchtime Tuesday and captured Crumbley within minutes of the shooting. His father bought the 9 mm Sig Sauer gun last week, according to the sheriff.\n\nIt was the deadliest school shooting since the Santa Fe, Texas, High School massacre in 2018, according to The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University Mass Killings database. The U.S. has had 31 mass killings this year of which 28 involved firearms.\n\nMcDonald said charges were being considered against Crumbley's parents.\n\n\"Owning a gun means securing it properly and locking it and keeping the ammunition separate,\" she said.\n\nThe shooting should be a wake-up call for new gun laws in a country that has become \"desensitized to school shootings,\" McDonald told reporters.\n\n\"We have to do better,\" the prosecutor said without offering specific changes. \"How many times does this have to happen? How many times?\"\n\nShe also said the terrorism charge fits.\n\n\"What about all the children who ran, screaming, hiding under desks? ... Those are victims, too, and so are their families and so is the community,\" McDonald said."}

The suit faulted the school district's superintendent and school principal for assuring parents of the school's safety despite knowing of disturbing social media posts and an online ammunition search by the accused shooter.\n\nThe 44-page lawsuit was filed in federal court on behalf of Riley Franz, 17, who was shot in the neck, and her sister Bella, 14, who was next to her at the time. Their parents, Jeffrey and Brandi Franz, also are plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\n\nRiley Franz was among the six students and a teacher seriously injured in the gunfire.\n\nCrumbley's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were charged with involuntary manslaughter and are being held in lieu of $500,000 bail. They gave him the gun as an early Christmas present and are accused of then ignoring warning signs that he was planning a shooting at the school.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Oxford Community School District, superintendent Timothy Throne, principal Steven Wolf, dean of students Ryan Moore, two unnamed teachers and two unnamed school counselors.\n\nThe district did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit describes Riley as a 12th grade honor roll student preparing to enter college and Bella as a ninth grade athlete.\n\n\"The horror of November 30, 2021 was entirely preventable,\" said the lawsuit, filed by Michigan personal injury attorney Geoffrey Fieger. \"Each and every defendant named herein created and increased the dangers then-existing at Oxford High School. The individually named Defendants are each responsible through their actions for making the student victims less safe.\"\n\nAmong the accusations in the lawsuit were several detailing Ethan Crumbley's threats of violence on social media as well as his using his cellphone to search for ammunition.\n\nThe lawsuit said that even though Throne and Wolf reviewed social media posts and were aware of the ammunition search reported by a teacher prior to the shooting, they improperly reassured all parents by email and other correspondence that their children were safe at Oxford, the lawsuit said. Similarly, students were assured there was no threat, it said.\n\n\"Plaintiff minors were safer before defendant Throne took action and advised each and every student, including plaintiff minors, that there was no credible threat,\" the suit stated."}

Dozens of Michigan school districts had already determined that the threats were not credible but some cancelled classes for the day out of an abundance of caution. Many people did not know about the threats until after they arrived at school.\n\nAfter his first-hour class at Canton High School, Mui went downstairs to share the students' concerns with the administration and found a long line of students already outside the attendance office being excused and picked up early by their parents.\n\nThe students were \"more nervous than I've seen them in a classroom before,\" Mui said. \"That's when it kind of hit home for me. I have students in the class that are asking about safety procedures, 'Can we lock the door?' and things like that, which I don't think the students ever cared about, whether the doors locked or not.\"\n\nBy 8:50 a.m. that morning, Plymouth-Canton Community Schools announced the decision to dismiss its three high schools at 9:30 a.m., writing to students, staff and families that although law enforcement had determined that there was no direct threat, \"the fear and anxiety at the P-CEP campus has caused significant disruption to the learning environment.\"\n\nSituations like these are becoming routine in Michigan as the state continues to grapple with the after-effects of the state's deadliest school attack in nearly a century. In the days and weeks following the shootings at Oxford High School, as copycat threats, bomb threats, and real and suspected weapons on campus locked down schools and cancel classes, teachers, parents, and students around Michigan worry about managing an educational environment already fragile from nearly two years of pandemic shutdowns and disruptions. Threats of school violence Dec. 17 were deemed not credible by the Department of Homeland Security, but they still prompted heightened school security or closures in several states across the country, including in Michigan, where the state police acknowledged the threat.\n\nMuch of the stress and uncertainty falls on educators. In interviews across the state, teachers told the PBS NewsHour they are tired, frustrated, and angry about continued gun violence in schools. In addition to their usual lessons – and answering students' questions about school shootings – teachers also have their own questions: How much can teachers manage? And what are the consequences if they don't?\n\n\"I'm now seeing things from the teacher perspective and the parent perspective,\" Stacey Olsen, a social studies teacher at Seaholm High School in Birmingham, said. \"That's giving me even more to contemplate. The professional has become even more personal.\"\n\nStudents have questions\n\nRyan Werenka, an advanced placement government and political science teacher at Troy High School for 22 years, told the PBS NewsHour that every year, a historic event occurs – national, international, or in this case very local – that forces him to set aside his lesson plan and debrief with his students to help them process the information, their thoughts, and their feelings. The day after the shooting at Oxford was that day.\n\nHe said students were unnerved because the shootings happened so close, about 20 miles from their school. Other students expressed fear about whether they were safe on school grounds, while some students were just trying to process why this happened and understand what would happen next."}

On Tuesday, Portland Public Schools also had to issue lockdowns and lockouts for three schools after a student allegedly robbed another with a weapon off campus, then came to school. Lebanon High School also was locked down, and South Albany High School had a false report of threat, as reported by the Albany Democrat-Herald.\n\n\"We've spoken to many, many parents this week who are concerned about this across the region,\" said Kraig Sproles, superintendent of the Bethel School District. \"What we're seeing is a lot of our students either hearing about a threat or mentioning it themselves. And we need to take that really seriously.\"\n\nIt's not surprising there were more threat concerns on the heels of Nov. 30 shooting in Michigan, Sproles said, as people often are more anxious following a violent act at schools involving guns.\n\n\"So I think that's part of it, but I also just think it's at a time when we as a society are a little bit more on edge and less resilient than we normally would be,\" he said.\n\nBethel had three separate incidents that were reported to staff last week, he said. One was regarding a text back-and-forth between two students in conflict. Another was a student conversation that involved a gun.\n\nSproles said they took care of that second incident, \"but then it kind of took on a life of its own on social media.\"\n\nSupporting students: How parents can help students cope with Oxford school shooting\n\nThe third was regarding a Willamette High School student who said they had a gun at school, prompting students to alert staff and have a brief lockdown Tuesday. When Eugene police responded and searched the student, no weapon was found. The student purported to have a gun and was carrying \"another object\" that could give the appearance of a gun, Eugene police spokesperson Melinda McLaughlin said Wednesday. The student was arrested for disorderly conduct in the first degree.\n\nSproles said in each instance, students brought their concerns to an adult they trusted, which is exactly what they should do.\n\nAfter hearing a student's concerns, Bethel staff are then prompted by their emergency training to take proper action depending on the situation.\n\n\"There's a chart in every single room that teachers and other staff can use to get the step-by-step information of what to do in an emergency,\" Bethel spokesperson Alisha Dodds said. \"So regardless of the emergency, they have that information at hand.\"\n\nBethel also has training for an active threat called ALICE, a protocol used in schools across the nation, which stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate.\n\nLessons learned\n\nThe biggest thing the recent incidents revealed for the district, though, was it needs to work out a better way of communicating with families in these situations.\n\n\"We need better communication with parents, in both communication during an event, and then communication immediately following an event, and in a time when most high school students have cellphones, they are texting their parents or communicating with their parents or community during an emergency totally different than they have in the past,\" Sproles said.\n\nSetbacks: Latest Oregon report card shows school enrollment declines, setbacks for some students to graduation\n\nInaccurate or incomplete information can easily be spread this way or via social media, and the district isn't always able to match that immediacy in the moment. To improve on this, the district is planning on holding a meeting with Willamette High parents this week, with the central topic of how to better work together.\n\n\"I think for parents, we need a little bit of feedback on the communication they expect during an emergency and what we can commit to providing,\" Sproles said.\n\nStudents also will be having more focused conversations about the incidents in homeroom."}

A judge set bond at $500,000 for each.\n\nTheir son, Ethan Crumbley, has been charged with murder and other crimes in Tuesday's mass shooting in Oxford Township, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit. Here is a timeline of events before the rampage and what has happened since:\n\nFriday, Nov. 26: James Crumbley buys a 9mm Sig Sauer from Acme Shooting Goods in Oxford, according to Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald. His 15-year-old son Ethan later posts a photo on Instagram of himself holding the semi-automatic handgun, writing: \"Just got my new beauty today. SIG SAUER 9mm. Any questions I will answer.\" He includes an emoji of a smiling face with heart eyes.\n\nSaturday, Nov. 27: Jennifer Crumbley writes on social media that it is a \"mom and son day testing out his new Christmas present,\" the prosecutor says.\n\nMonday, Nov. 29: A teacher sees Ethan, a sophomore at Oxford High, searching online for ammunition with his cellphone during class and reports it to school officials, McDonald says. Ethan meets with a school counselor and another staff member. He says he and his mother recently went to a shooting range and that shooting sports are a family hobby, according to Oxford Community Schools Superintendent Tim Throne.\n\nSchool personnel call his mother, leave a voicemail and email her. She does not respond. While exchanging text messages with her son, she writes: \"Lol. I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.\"\n\nThat night, Ethan Crumbley records a video in which he discusses killing students, according to sheriff's Lt. Tim Willis.\n\nTuesday, Nov. 30: A teacher finds a note on Ethan's desk that alarms her enough to take a photo, the prosecutor says. It includes a drawing of a handgun and the words: \"The thoughts won't stop. Help me.\" Also depicted is a bullet with the words \"blood everywhere\" above a person who appears to have been shot twice and is bleeding. A laughing emoji is drawn below the figure. The note also says \"my life is useless\" and \"the world is dead.\" The teacher reports the information to school counselors and the dean.\n\nA counselor removes Ethan from the classroom and takes him to the office with his backpack. The counselor obtains the drawing, but Ethan has already scratched out portions. He says the drawing is part of a video game he is designing and that he wants a career as a video game designer, the superintendent says."}

Hagins is being held without bond and is set to appear before a judge on Friday for an arraignment.\n\nHagins, a student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, faces a charge of terrorism, a charge for written threats to injure or kill and an attempted first-degree homicide charge, police announced in a press release.\n\nDuring a news conference, Daytona Beach Police Chief Jakari Young said Hagins referenced the 1999 school shooting at Columbine High School, which left 13 people dead.\n\nThe police chief emphasized how important it was that the two students reported Hagins to police before he committed any violence.\n\n\"This is the way we combat what's going on in this country right now,\" Young said. \"Most people who carry out shootings like this, somebody knows something. But they usually fail to bring it to the authorities' attention. So the credit truly goes to those two students that stepped up, came forward and brought this to our attention.\"\n\nHagins was apparently in danger of failing classes and was cited for a traffic citation a day before the arrest, police said. He had sold his car to purchase a folding rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, they added.\n\nHagins had also recently posted pictures of his gun and written that he was \"finished with his school shopping\" on Snapchat, according to Spectrum News in Florida.\n\nYoung said Hagins planned to practice his marksmanship at Volusia Top Gun, a shooting range. On Friday, the student was headed to Embry-Riddle for the last day of the semester, when the largest number of students were expected to be be on campus.\n\n\"This was all in his plan,\" Young said, saying Hagins \"has already confessed. He may want to claim it was all a joke and he wasn't serious about it, but we don't find anything funny about discussing a mass shooting on campus.\"\n\nTwo students reported the Snapchat messages to campus police, who called the Daytona Beach Police Department.

A 2018 study found that states with stricter background checks for weapon and ammunition purchases had fewer school shootings.\n\nHowever, support for stricter gun control has fallen, according to a recent Gallup poll. Only 52% of respondents said they wanted stricter gun laws, the lowest recording since 2014.\n\nIt is not clear yet where the handgun — a 9mm Sig Sauer SP 2022 pistol — used by the 15-year-old shooting suspect had been purchased.

(WLBT) - If you missed a few of the most important headlines and need to play catch up, no worries. WLBT has gathered some of the top stories from our website to get you up to speed.\n\n1. Weekend homicides\n\nJackson Police Department (WLBT)\n\nThe Jackson Police Department is investigating a shooting that occurred around 10:30 p.m. Saturday. According to police, Antoinette Robinson was shot multiple times while sitting inside her Nissan Altima at Winter Street and Dalton Street. Deputy Chief Deric Hearn says Robinson was transported to UMMC, where she died.\n\nThree people were also found dead around 12:30 a.m. Sunday. Jackson Police Department Spokesperson Sam Brown says officers responded to a shooting in the 800 block of Britton Street. According to Brown, once officers arrived, they discovered 43-year-old Jessie Bullock, 56-year-old James Bullock, and 60-year-old Colleen Bullock dead from gunshot wounds.\n\n2. Changes for Mississippi judicial races\n\nPoliticians running for governor, attorney general or many other Mississippi offices are free to make all sorts of promises about what they'll do if elected. Judicial candidates are supposed to be much more reserved, according to the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct. They can promise to be fair, but they cannot pledge specific outcomes on particular types of cases. That doesn't stop outside groups from spending money — sometimes piles of money — to promote one judicial candidate or disparage another. Under change recently made by a majority of the Mississippi Supreme Court, the public could receive less information about findings of unethical behavior during judicial campaigns. For years, Mississippi has had a committee to keep an eye on races for Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, chancery court, circuit court and county court judges. The committee was created because of concerns about the increasing amount of money flowing into the state to influence the elections, especially for the top courts. In an order issued Nov. 30, the state Supreme Court revised the committee's size and scope of operations. Instead of having a five-person committee that serves for a single election year, the state now has a nine-person committee that serves for multiple years."}

We are a very small school system with only four schools.\"\n\nIt was one among hundreds of examples of school systems grappling with how to respond to vague threats afloat on social media in the wake of the tragedy at Oxford High, which left four dead and seven seriously injured. These kinds of disturbing messages are spiking in the D.C. area and nationwide: At least 60 schools in Michigan closed this month in the wake of the Oxford shooting, as did districts in Ohio and Pennsylvania. And in a \"challenge\" last week that swept the social network TikTok, students promoted school shootings to take place on Dec. 17 — for many, the last day of class before winter break. Schools from D.C. to California closed for the day or added police.\n\nMore than 150 threats surfaced nationwide in just the week after Oxford, said James Densley, a professor of criminal justice at Metropolitan State University and a co-founder of the Violence Project. By comparison, Densley, who tracks news reports, recorded 151 school threats for the entire month of September this year — itself a fivefold increase over the number seen in a typical September, he said.\n\nEvery threat sets off alarm bells, putting staffers, parents and students on edge — and forcing administrators to make a choice. Should they close schools, an option that is more attractive in a post-pandemic world in which many students can learn from home? Or should they take a risk in an effort to minimize learning disruption? Assessing the danger of each threat is not always obvious.\n\nFor Jason Enix, superintendent of the Reading Community City School District just outside Cincinnati, the decision was clear. When a social media post surfaced earlier this month promising a student was going to \"shoot up the school,\" Enix opted to have students learn virtually the next day. \"It was an easy call to make,\" he said. \"We would make that call every single time.\"\n\nBut when Daniel McGarry, superintendent of the Upper Darby School District in Pennsylvania, faced a similar situation in early December, before the Oxford attack, he kept students learning in a \"lock-in\" scenario, under which teachers continue teaching but nobody is allowed to leave their classroom. \"Our last resort is to close schools,\" McGarry said.\n\nExperts are similarly conflicted — emphasizing the need to err on the side of caution but warning of possible downsides.\n\n\"I think we have to take every single threat very seriously right now — it doesn't matter how it might seem innocuous,\" said Laurel Thompson, who is on the board of the School Social Work Association of America (SSWAA) and was involved in the response to the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Fla. \"We never know which one is going to be the one. We never want to make a mistake.\"\n\nAmy Klinger, founder and director of programs for the Educator's School Safety Network, commended schools for taking threats seriously. But she said she would like to see fewer campus shutdowns, because a return to virtual learning can cause trauma and anxiety for students who suffered in that environment during the pandemic. And, she warned, school closures could lead to even more threats surfacing on social media.\n\n\"A kid could think, 'I made a threat and it worked, we don't have school, so I'm going to do that again,'\" Klinger said. \"And copycats create copycats and you get into this cycle of threat closure, threat closure, threat closure, so it's very difficult.\"\n\n'Fake accounts ... fake threats'\n\nThe threats run the gamut."}

Donations can be dropped off at the school's main office.\n\nThursday night, students, teachers, staff and community members came together in prayer and support, one day after the deadly shooting at the Winston-Salem high school.\n\nMore than 100 people were in attendance at the vigil held at Mount Tabor United Methodist Church, which is close to the school campus.\n\n\"How is everyone doing,\" asked Mount Tabor High School Principal Ed Weiss as he walked around checking in on students before the vigil commenced.\n\nRoughly 32 hours had passed since a student was shot just after noon Wednesday, putting the school on lockdown as police and sheriff's deputies launched a six-hour manhunt. Other schools in the district were also put on lockdown just to be cautious.\n\nA Mount Tabor High School coach and teacher attending the vigil, Rick Anderson, said, \"Yesterday was the scariest and toughest thing I've ever dealt with.\" He also commended his colleagues and law enforcement for doing everything they could to keep the rest of the students safe.\n\nThe sheriff's office said deputies arrested the suspected shooter around 6 p.m. Wednesday. The Forsyth County District Attorney hinted that the incident may have been gang related at a news conference Thursday morning.\n\nDuring a news conference Wednesday, officials said they believed the suspect was a student at the school.\n\nDistrict Attorney Jim O'Neill refused to give specifics about the case, but did say, \"If a child enters a gang at 6th or 7th grade, we've lost them folks.\"\n\nGov. Roy Cooper joined Winston-Salem and Forsyth County officials Thursday.\n\n\"I wanted to come today to let the people of this community to know that the State of North Carolina was behind them, and we wanted to provide all the help that we could,\" Cooper said. \"This is a pain and a fear that no child or parent should ever have to confront, simply by having a child go to school,\" he said.\n\nForsyth County Sheriff Bobby Kimbrough Tuesday said the victim's mother asked him to share her son's name: William Chavis Raynard Miller Jr. He succumbed to his injuries after being taken to a hospital Wednesday.\n\nThe sheriff said he spoke with the mother again, and she asked him to share another message with the public: \"Tell the mothers to tell their babies to put their guns down, because it's senseless.\"\n\nThe sheriff said there were two school resource officers, which he calls SROs, at Mount Tabor High when the student was shot.\n\n\"The time in which we're living in, SROs are a necessity in our schools,\" he said. \"There are so many social issues in our society and our community that become criminal justice issues, and they spill over in different places.\"\n\n\"I can tell you that guns are easily accessible in our society now,\" Kimbrough said. \"In a school that is basically, people, young men and women are coming and going, bookbags and so many other areas, you can't control that.\"\n\nKimbrough, Cooper and the other officials who spoke during a news conference Thursday all said student safety was their priority. This is the second school shooting in North Carolina this week. A 15-year-old in New Hanover County faces attempted murder charges after a shooting in Wilmington that injured another student.\n\nThe shootings come a week after most students went back to school, many for the first time in more than a year.\n\n\"We know that our children need to be in the classroom to get the full experience of learning, and that's why we've worked through this pandemic and why so many, more than 90% of our children are under a mask mandate,\" the governor said."}

The Wolverines had just won the Big Ten championship for the first time in 17 years and locked up a spot in the College Football Playoff for the first time.\n\nBut no, that's not what this particular moment was about.\n\nThis was about what that number stood for, and it was far more than simply the result of a complete effort by a football team that looks like it's on a mission.\n\nThis was about honoring Tate Myre, the junior football player at Oxford High School who was one of four students killed this week in a mass shooting. Myre was No. 42 for the Wildcats and on Saturday, the Wolverines wore a patch honoring the victims that included the No. 42, the number Myre wore.\n\n\"When you read all the accounts and talking to Coach (Zach) Line at Oxford High School, Tate was a warrior, football player, wrestler, best athlete in the school,\" Harbaugh said. \"And the best athlete in the school could have easily made it out of that school and been the first one out.\n\n\"But while people were running away from that fire, he was running into it. And he's a hero. I'm glad — our players got soul, too. They've got big hearts. They're incredible guys.\"\n\nMyre's family was also on hand, taking part in the pregame coin toss. Parents Buck and Sheri Myre were joined by their sons, Trent and Ty, with each wearing Oxford Strong T-shirts and Oxford hats as they stood at midfield just before kickoff.\n\n\"When Aidan came to me, and it was Aidan that came to me,\" Harbaugh said, \"and wanted to dedicate the game to Tate Myre, I said, 'Yes. Let's do that.' That was huge, and then when it was 42 points and we all looked up there, we were like ...\"\n\nHarbaugh trailed off, looking to his star defensive end who had been named the game's most valuable player.\n\n\"God works in mysterious ways,\" Hutchinson said. \"Man, it's crazy.\"\n\nThe plan of having Myre's family come to Indianapolis came together quickly, Harbaugh said. The idea came from Hutchinson and other players and soon athletic director Warde Manuel set out to make it happen."}

Morris, Mich., that has sold door locks to 300 school districts in Michigan and about 10,000 districts across the country.\n\n\"It's not a lock until it needs to be, it's a piece of hardware that mounts to the door and another piece that mounts to the floor. The locking device is a red handle that lives in a wallbox on the wall beside the door,'' said Cris Ahearn, director of sales for Nightlock.\n\nIn the event of a lockdown or a drill, the box is opened, the red handle removed. One end is slid into a slot into the door; the other end fits into a notch in a metal plate mounted on the floor.\n\n\"If a classroom door has glass ... and the perpetrator tries to break the glass and reach in and turn the handle to gain entry into the room, they can't do that because the door is locked at the floor,'' Ahearn said.\n\nOxford started installing the locks in 2017, according to Nightlock records. One version installed works on doors that swing outward or inward. Another version works on outward swinging doors which most classroom doors are. Oxford had a mix of both locks at the high school and districtwide.\n\nThe locks average about $50 per door.\n\nThe alleged shooter never entered a classroom during the shooting spree that killed four students and wounded six more students and a teacher on Tuesday, Nov. 30.\n\nThose killed and wounded were fired upon in the hallways.\n\n\"The first thing I thought of was at least they have our locks. Then we're watching it unfold at our computers and at first they were saying no loss of life and we were relieved. Then we found out that was not the case,'' Ahearn said. \"For the whole emotional week we've gone through I keep thinking about how do you lock down the hallways? We can provide safe rooms in every office and every classroom, but if you're in the hallway, then you're exposed and it's tragic.''\n\nOakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard reviewed the crime scene last week and credited Oxford Community Schools with taking safety precautions.\n\n\"There is an extensive camera system thanks to the proactive work of Oxford schools. ... Our liaison taught them ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate),'' Bouchard said. \"Desks were upturned, doors were barricaded, doors were actually hit by gunfire and so were barricades. But the doors were safe, so that behavior, that training, those protocols saved lives.''\n\nOn Friday and Monday, the phone were ringing at Nightlock's offices.\n\n\"It's not the reason you want the phone to ring, our hearts are broken and devastated. I have friends who have kids that go to that school. It's tragic,'' Ahearn said.\n\n\"A lot of districts are trying to harden their facilities,'' Ahearn said.\n\nNightlock started making residential locks to prevent home invasions after the owners' parents home was broken into while their mom was there. They came up with a residential lock as a hobby and sold it on the internet. They ran their father's steel company full-time.\n\nThen came the 26 deaths in 2021— including 20 children — at Sandy Hook Elementary, in Newtown, Conn.\n\n\"After Sandy Hook, teachers started calling, they wanted these devices for their classrooms but that (residential) device doesn't meet code as far classroom for egress,'' Ahearn said. \"So the lockdown device was designed based on a collaboration with school administrators and code officials to come up with something that is safe and effective. We've been doing that since 2012, since Sandy Hook.\"\n\nShe said in the past week they've received an outpouring of emails and social media posts from parents and children thanking them that the school had the locks."}

The massacre ranks among the worst school shootings in U.S. history.\n\nRemington, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018 and again last year, manufactured the Bushmaster assault-style AR-15 rifle that was used in the shooting.\n\nThe families sued Remington for wrongful death, accusing it of having recklessly marketed the military-grade Bushmaster to civilians. Remington has argued that the Bushmaster is a legal firearm and that the sale of the one used in the school shooting to Lanza's mother was legal.\n\nNPR received no immediate response for comment from Remington, nor from a lawyer representing the company.\n\nThe families' lead attorney, Joshua Koskoff, said Remington's subpoenas covered the kindergarten and first-grade records for the five student victims whose families are suing — Jesse Lewis, Daniel Barden, Dylan Hockley, Benjamin Wheeler and Noah Pozner, the Courant reports.\n\nKoskoff said there was \"no explanation\" for the decision by Remington to seek the records. \"The records cannot possibly excuse Remington's egregious marketing conduct, or be of any assistance in estimating the catastrophic damages in this case,\" he said, according to the Post. \"The only relevant part of their attendance records is that they were at their desks on December 14, 2012.\"\n\nIn a motion, Koskoff asked presiding Judge Barbara Bellis to expand a confidentiality order issued previously to cover the records, calling Remington's subpoenas an irrelevant invasion of privacy, according to the Courant."}

Four students were killed and seven people were wounded last month during the Oxford shooting rampage.\n\nIn Waterford, about 20 miles from Oxford High School, Police Chief Scott Underwood said his officers investigated three reports of threats by students and took four children into custody, including two from an elementary school.\n\nJust 5 minutes: A gunman turned a normal day at Oxford High into a nightmare\n\nA statement from Underwood said two 9-year-old students had a \"'naughty/nice' list with several names on each, as well as the words 'alive' and 'dead' on each side of the lists.\" They were taken to police headquarters and later turned over to their parents, with juvenile petitions to be submitted to the Oakland County Prosecutor's Office to consider charges, the statement said.\n\nAn eighth-grade student told another student that he brought a gun to school and mimicked shooting the gun with his hand, the statement said.

Both students had hearings pending Thursday.\n\nAlso in Waterford, two middle school students, who were taken into custody earlier this week after allegedly making threats, made recent court appearances. Both were charged with knowingly making a false threat of terrorism, which could carry 20 years in prison, according to Underwood.\n\n\"Students who think this (is) a way to be funny, or gain some kind of recognition from their classmates, are making a very big mistake (and) it is imperative that parents have a serious conversation with their children,\" Underwood said in the release.\n\nIn Wayne County, which includes Detroit, similar cases followed the deadly shooting at Oxford High school, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said."}

Researchers have an answer.\n\nA Virginia public school student suggested he might carry out an ethnic cleansing at his school. Officials were alarmed, but they weren't sure whether he was serious. They convened a team to assess the threat and notified the police, who found an unsecured loaded semiautomatic pistol in a search of his home.\n\nAn investigation revealed online messages with a friend in another state considering a similar act — acts that police then thwarted, according to Dewey Cornell, a scholar who keeps track of these incidents but does not give out time or location information to protect the confidentiality of the districts and students.\n\nOne of the stickiest dilemmas that counselors and teachers face is how to know which students are poised to commit a horrid act of violence and which ones just need help, even urgently. Every day, they walk a terrifying tightrope: Removing every student who shows disturbing behaviors would amount to a huge overreaction. Missing just one true killer could be a tragic underreaction.\n\n\"It boils down to a judgment call,\" said Melissa Reeves, former president of the National Association of School Psychologists. \"We don't have a cookbook that says if this situation happens, do this.\"\n\nIncreasingly, school officials rely on sophisticated threat detection systems designed to head off horrific mass shootings like the one last week in Oxford, Mich. When officials encounter concerns, they might look at social media posts, search a student's locker or desk and examine academic and disciplinary records. Officials might investigate the student's access to weapons, recent stressful events in the student's life, evidence of depression or suicidal thoughts, evidence of planning an attack and consistency of a student's statements and actions.\n\nIn Oxford, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley came to the attention of guidance counselors, who sent him back to class. Later that day, he is alleged to have opened fire, killing four students and injuring seven others.\n\nMany academics, school officials and law enforcement agencies suggest decisions like this be made by a much larger, multidisciplinary team including administrators, school-based police officers and mental health professionals such as school counselors, psychologists and social workers.\n\n\"It doesn't rest on one person's shoulders, or one or two,\" said Michele Gay, whose 7-year-old daughter Josephine was killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Gay now runs a nonprofit organization that brings threat assessment training to U.S. schools. \"We know that it works, we know it saves lives.\"\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has long wrestled with this problem as it has sought to evaluate people who might attack the president or other protected officials. In 1999, after a mass shooting at Columbine High School outside Denver left 13 people dead, the agency realized its methods could be used to evaluate threats in schools, too, and began sharing its tools with educators. By 2018, the Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center had published a 32-page guide that recommended multidisciplinary threat assessment teams, with a set of criteria for intervention. The FBI also sees threat assessment as a valuable tool in trying to prevent mass school shootings.\n\n\"You can't catch someone falling from a building if you're the only one holding the net,\" said Katherine Schweit, a former FBI special agent and author of the book, \"Stop the Killing: How to End the Mass Shooting Crisis.\"\n\nMass shootings in the U.S. are overwhelmingly committed by men. Experts are examining the place of masculinity in the gun debate. (Video: Nicki DeMarco, Erin Patrick O'Connor, Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech, in which 32 people were killed, Virginia became the first state to mandate threat assessment teams, taking the approach recommended by the Secret Service. The requirement was imposed first on universities and, in 2013, on K-12 schools. Now at least 11 states require schools to put these teams in place. One study found that by 2017, about half of American secondary schools and more than 40 percent of primary schools used threat assessment teams."}

Eight people were wounded, some critically, including a 14-year-old girl who was placed on a ventilator after surgery.\n\nInvestigators were still trying to determine a motive for the shooting Tuesday at Oxford High School, located in a community of about 22,000 people roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Detroit, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said.\n\n\"The person that's got the most insight and the motive is not talking,\" he said at a news conference late Tuesday.\n\nDeputies rushed to the school around lunch time as more than 100 calls flooded 911 dispatchers with reports of a shooter.

The vandalism prompted school administrators to post two letters to parents on the school's website, saying they were responding to rumors of a threat against the school but had found none.\n\nBouchard said the student in custody had no previous run-ins with his department and he wasn't aware of any disciplinary history at school.\n\n\"That's part of our investigation to determine what happened prior to this event and if some signs were missed how were they missed and why,\" he said.\n\nThe campus was placed on lockdown during the attack, with some children sheltering in locked classrooms.

It's a lovely gesture for the touch-and-go students and a teacher who are still fighting to survive their bullet wounds, although obviously too late to help the four who already succumbed. The location for the blood drive is the Bass Pro Shop parking lot, where if you like, you can purchase a 9 mm semiautomatic Sig Sauer pistol just like the one the 15-year-old sophomore used to murder and maim.\n\nA press release about the blood drive arrived in the newsroom today, a trumpeting announcement inviting do-gooders to come out and do some good. And while we're happy to help get the word out, one can't help but wonder how nobody saw the irony here. Or maybe they did and just didn't care? To be fair, ironies like this one are impossible to escape in the United States circa 2021, where we love our kids, but love our guns more.\n\nBasic logistics suggest Arkansas blood is unlikely to make it into the veins of injured Michiganders. Still, the sentiment is nice. The need for blood usually goes up around the holidays, in Michigan and everywhere else. Plus, here's a great opportunity to pretend you're doing something about gun violence without actually doing anything about gun violence at all. Expect to see some NRA-endorsed Republican politicians there with sleeves rolled up. School shootings have become America's signature move, and no amount of junior-sized body bags seem to convince these NRA-owned lawmakers that maybe giving the gun lobby and gun manufacturers free rein isn't a healthy idea.\n\nThe school shooting in Michigan on Tuesday has a few unique traits. The gun used was a brand new one, a Black Friday purchase by the dad of the shooter. We don't yet know much about the gunman. But his name hasn't yet been released and he's reportedly on suicide watch in a juvenile detention facility, which means we can safely assume he's white. Black kids who shoot other kids tend to get publicly named and charged as adults right off the bat.\n\nGun violence rates, and school shooting rates especially, have been spiking up in recent years, as chest-thumping Trumpublicans arm themselves for civil war or whatever, and cunning lobbyists push through stand your ground laws to help white men get away with murder. This year is on pace to be the worst for gun violence in decades.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans, Republican and Democrat alike, oppose our insane menu of laws that put our children in the crosshairs by making guns available anytime, anywhere, for pretty much anyone. But the majority of lawmakers clearly think our laws are fine. And doing the unglamorous grassroots work of fighting the NRA's bought-and-paid-for operatives in Congress and state houses is a slog. An exhausting, heartbreaking slog.\n\nIt would be cool if voters would call their representatives today and ask for meaningful gun safety legislation, like universal background checks and safe storage requirements so 15-year-olds can't just pick up dad's new gun and pick off their classmates.\n\nOr you can just go give some blood from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Bass Pro Shop parking lot if it makes you feel better."}

Backpacks will no longer be allowed in schools and the district is working with a vendor to provide clear backpacks, she added.\n\nEthan Crumbley, a 15-year-old Oxford High student, has been charged as an adult with murder and other crimes.\n\nHis parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, are charged in the case with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a judge granted a prosecutor more time to collect and share additional evidence against the parents, partly to give the Michigan community \"time to heal\" during the holiday season.\n\nThey're accused of giving their son access to a gun and failing to intervene when they were confronted with his disturbing drawings a few hours before the Nov. 30 shooting.\n\nSchool officials have been criticized by the county sheriff and Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald for not alerting a school resource officer about their concerns with the teen and not searching his backpack before allowing him to return to class about three hours before the shooting at the school about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit.\n\nLori Bourgeau, 45, an Oxford Village councilwoman and parent of an 11th-grader, pointed a finger at the board and policies in place before the shooting.\n\n\"Who sets the example of where the complaints (about students) go?\" Bourgeau said during public participation at Tuesday night's meeting. \"You let it stay with the counselor and the dean of students, only.

The next minute, two people were bleeding from gunshot wounds – one of which would prove to be fatal – and everyone was reeling from confusion and shock.\n\nHere is a moment-by-moment account of what happened that day, based on a search warrant affidavit and 911 calls.\n\nA sudden shot rang out on set\n\nThe crew was filming on October 21, 2021, at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a Western movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico.

One camera was set up, but because they were just rehearsing, nothing was being filmed or recorded.\n\nAssistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \"cold gun!,\" indicating it was unloaded. He then handed it to Baldwin, who sat in a church pew facing the camera and crew.\n\nBaldwin was demonstrating a \"cross draw\" – pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera.\n\nIt was about 1:50 p.m. Souza told deputies he was viewing the scene through the camera and nearby monitors when he heard \"what sounded like a whip and then a loud pop.\""}

The revolvers require no modifications to operate with blank cartridges. A live round with the projectile or a blank round with no projectile will both fit. These guns are generally rented by the prop master or armorer from a rental house in the business.\n\nThe revolvers on Westerns are manually cocked with a hammer by your thumb to turn a cylinder holding the cartridges. Every pull of that hammer indexes one round in line with the barrel and the hammer stays back. By pulling the trigger the hammer drops. It has a firing pin on it that penetrates a hole in the rear of the frame of the gun.\n\nCampbell: Part of the family: Why domestic violence victims won't leave unless their pets are safe\n\nIt pokes past the frame – striking the rear of a brass cartridge loaded in one of the cylinder's chambers, hitting a small circular object on the back of that cartridge.

Those involved look back\n\nOne reason for the shock, horror and 24/7 media coverage of the Oct. 21 accidental shooting death on the set of \"Rust\" in New Mexico is that such on-set tragedies are rare: The last one was nearly 30 years ago, and the one before that was in 1984.\n\nYet some of the details in the 1993 shooting death of actor Brandon Lee on the set of \"The Crow\" in Wilmington, N.C., echo across the decades to Santa Fe, N.M., where \"Rust\" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was wounded by a gun fired by star and co-producer Alec Baldwin.\n\nThe guns in both cases were real and functional, but different makes. In both cases, the guns fired lead projectiles, unbeknownst to the actors and crew. In both cases, the guns were not properly checked before their use.\n\nRising star Lee, the son of actor Bruce Lee, was 28 at the time and about to get married. At 42, Hutchins, the mother of a young son, was an up-and-coming star in her field of cinematography.\n\n\"So unnecessary,\" lamented the former district attorney in Wilmington Jerry Spivey, who supervised the investigation of the Lee case.\n\nAnd so infrequent, say others involved in the case.\n\n\"In the course of those nearly 30 years, there have been thousands of movies involving gun play of one sort of another, and hundreds of thousands of shots fired, so really this is a very, very rare event,\" says James Janowitz, the New York lawyer who led the defense of the producers of \"The Crow\" in a subsequent civil lawsuit.\n\nOne difference between then and now: Baldwin is a bigger, more controversial star than the actor who fired the weapon that killed Lee, Michael Massee, then 41, a veteran character actor who died of stomach cancer at age 64 in 2016.\n\nThe gun Masse fired in a scene was supposed to contain blanks but unbeknownst to anyone, the gun's barrel contained a fragment of a lead bullet left over from an earlier scene.\n\n'Rust' shooting investigation: Halyna Hutchins' husband hires wrongful death attorney\n\nMassee was devastated by the tragedy, he said in a 2005 interview with \"Extra.\" He took a year off from acting and never saw \"The Crow,\" which resumed production after Lee's death and was released in May 1994 to good reviews and nearly $95 million at the global box office.\n\n\"I don't think you ever get over something like that,\" Massee said.\n\nAfter 1993, it wasn't supposed to happen again, says Spivey, in an interview with USA TODAY. After the investigation, he decided not to file criminal charges in the case.\n\n\"The hope was no person would ever again be killed on a movie set by a gun thought to be safe,\" he said. \"That's been the case until now. You have to go back to the hard and fast rule of no live ammunition on any movie set. Ever.\"\n\nAs Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza pointed out at a press conference Wednesday, Hollywood has had \"a record recently of being safe.\"\n\nBut the \"Rust\" set has been dogged by reports of a partial crew walkout over workplace complaints and safety issues, just hours before the accidental shooting."}

Well, already, two of the Rust EPs are wiping their hands clean of the situation.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the now shuttered production, Allen Cheney made it known in a statement provided to the press Wednesday that he, along with Emily Salveson and her Streamline Global finance company, \"received Executive Producer credit on the film Rust having no involvement with the physical and day to day production,\" which is \"consistent with financing partners across productions of all sizes.\"\n\n(L-R) DP Halyna Hutchins on left who was died on set of 'Rust', director/writer Joel Souza who was injured and star/producer Alec Baldwin ICFC; Mega\n\nCheney further defended the experience of the producers of the production, which saw Baldwin on October 21 discharge a long Colt .45 revolver during a \"quick draw\" rehearsal, with a \"live round\" striking Hutchins and director Joel Souza, according to police. Baldwin, who also serves as a producer on Rust, was informed by First Assistant Director Dave Halls that he had been given what's known as a \"cold gun.\" That was not the case, as the death of Hutchins and injuring of the film's director Joel Souza in the shoulder that afternoon tragically revealed.\n\n\"The six credited producers on the independent film Rust, Ryan Smith, Alec Baldwin, Nathan Klingher, Ryan Winterstern, Matt DelPiano and Anjul Nigam, collectively have more than 35 years' experience producing small to mid-level film and television projects,\" said Cheney's statement.\n\n\"Rust is a union-certified production, in good standing with all of the major production unions and guilds, including IATSE, the Teamsters, SAG, and DGA,\" said Cheney. IATSE has ripped Rust for hiring non-union crew when the camera team walked out.\n\nA rusted chain hangs on the fence at the entrance to the Bonanza Creek Ranch film set in Santa Fe, N.M., AP\n\nIn the aftermath of the killing of Hutchins, many have tried to sort out who is financially responsible for the oversee of a production that allegedly cut a number of corners.\n\nHere's what we've parsed out so far.\n\nFirst and foremost, Bondit Media Capital did not have any equity stake in Rust, despite being named a co-financier. We've learned that the production finance lender, whose feature credits include the upcoming Bruce Willis-John Travolta re-team Paradise City, loaned money to production against distribution collateral. Bondit did not respond for comment on this story.\n\nRust was not bonded. Two of the three U.S. completion bond firms were approached about bonding the project, according to sources, but it didn't happen. In one of the two cases, a potential financier made inquiries with one and stepped back from the film when the company declined to issue a bond.\n\nBondit generally does not require completion bonds to lend and has been active in getting productions up and running during Covid.\n\nBonds are like super-insurance, with the bond company on the hook for costs if a film isn't delivered in time and on budget. Productions also have traditional insurance, in Rust's case said to be from Chubb, which declined to comment."}

The movie's director, Joel Souza, 48, was taken by ambulance to a medical center.\n\nIt was not clear if Baldwin was performing at the time of the shooting or how many rounds were fired, and little was known about the weapon.\n\nProp guns fire blanks, gunpowder charges that produce a flash and a bang but not a hard projectile. But when the trigger is pulled, the paper or plastic wadding is ejected from the barrel with enough force that it can be lethal at close range.\n\nHollywood weapons expert Larry Zanoff told NBC News that when firearms are used as props in the television and movie industry, only blank cartridges that do not hold bullets are allowed on set. Zanoff said there is a minimum safety distance of 20 feet and \"nothing\" should be in front of the muzzle when filming is occurring.\n\n\"We have a series of guidelines in the industry that govern the use of blank firearms and ammunition on set,\" he said. \"So my question is of course, firstly, was that protocol followed?\"\n\nHutchins' shocking on-set death immediately drew comparisons to the untimely death of Brandon Lee.\n\nIn 1993, Brandon Lee, 28, son of the late martial-arts star Bruce Lee, died after being hit by a .44-caliber slug while filming a death scene for the movie \"The Crow.\" The gun was supposed to have fired a blank, but an autopsy turned up a bullet lodged near his spine.\n\nLee's death was the last recorded accidental death by a prop gun on a movie set.\n\nA verified Twitter account for Brandon — run by his sister, Shannon Lee, according to the account's bio — tweeted early Friday that \"No one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set. Period.\"\n\nIn 1984, actor Jon-Erik Hexum died after shooting himself in the head with a prop gun blank while pretending to play Russian roulette with a .44 Magnum on the set of the CBS television series \"Cover Up.\"\n\nIn 1982, Actor Vic Morrow, 53, and child actors Myca Dinh Le, 7, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, 6, were killed in a helicopter crash on the set of \"Twilight Zone: The Movie.\" An explosion during a chase scene sent the helicopter crashing to the ground.\n\nTheir deaths prompted increased safety regulations for stunts and also resulted in a trial in which director John Landis and others on the production team were ultimately acquitted of involuntary manslaughter charges.\n\nThe prop firearm was discharged by actor Alec Baldwin while filming \"Rush\" in Santa Fe, N.M., according to authorities. The film's director of photography was killed and the director was injured.\n\nAnd while filming accidents resulting in death or injury of a big movie or TV star is rare, a 2016 Associated Press report found that, since 1990, at least 43 people have died on sets in the U.S. and more than 150 have been left with life-altering injuries."}

A \"misfire\" does not result in a gun firing but the opposite: it doesn't fire at all.\n\nSecondly, it isn't an \"accident\" when you point a loaded handgun at someone and pull the trigger. In real life, it's assault with a deadly weapon to intentionally point a firearm at someone, loaded or not. In the context of a movie, it's irresponsible and negligent.\n\nWe also reacted to the word \"prop\" being used to describe the firearm itself. To us—and to most people, I'd guess—a prop is a rubber, wood or even metal representation of a firearm but is not an actual, functioning weapon that is capable of firing real ammunition that can maim or kill. A prop-gun is a realistic-looking toy that movies use to play make-believe for the camera. If a Bengal tiger had been on the movie set and mauled two people, one of them fatally, would anyone call it a \"prop tiger\"?\n\nIn just a matter of days, contradictory details emerged. The gun wasn't a toy but an actual firearm. The police have seized some 500 rounds of various types of ammunition from the set including blanks, dummy rounds and live ammunition. At least three people appear to have handled the pistol before it was fired, including the armorer hired to safely handle these weapons, an assistant director, and Baldwin himself. This means there were three chances to make sure the firearm was not loaded with live ammunition.\n\nAs far as we know, the film's 24-year-old head armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, had no special training or licenses to ensure she was qualified (beyond whatever she may have been taught by her father, a well-known Hollywood armorer). By contrast, if animals are used in a movie, the set is closely supervised by an American Humane Society Certified Animal Safety Representative who oversees the treatment of the animals. Movie companies get their scripts approved by the AHS in advance and they sign off on the credentials of any animal handlers assigned to the film, which often include veterinarians. In exchange for following these practices, producers are permitted by AHS to say in the credits, \"No animals were harmed in the production of this film.\"\n\nSo while Hollywood is very serious about the safe handling of animals on the set and the safety of the crew around those animals, this is not the case with guns. There are guidelines covering basic rules of safety issued by studios on how to treat firearms. Under the \"Safety on the Set\" category for Warner Brothers Studios website, they even type them all in capital letters so you know they really mean business.\n\nThere is such a thing as a \"Licensed Armorer\" for movie companies but that license comes from their union, not any state agency or organization specifically engaged in firearms safety training."}

It also arguably started the love affair between Hollywood and firearms, with guns becoming as commonplace and everlasting on film sets as gaffers tape and catering.\n\nYet an Oct. 21 tragedy on the set of another Western, Rust — where Alec Baldwin accidentally shot and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza while practicing a cross draw with a loaded gun he had been told was safe to handle — might very well change the industry's stance toward live and even less-than-live weapons.\n\n\"This can't happen again,\" declares Black Panther director of photography Rachel Morrison, the first woman nominated for an Oscar for cinematography for the 2017 film Mudbound. \"Not ever. The technology is there to do most things without live fire.\"\n\nAgreed Cassian Elwes, who produced Lee Daniels' The Butler and the upcoming New Mexico-set science-fiction movie Robots: \"The time has come to say that we shouldn't even be firing blanks on sets. Unfortunately, we live in a society where guns are part of the culture. Screenwriters use guns for excitement, effect, drama, comedy. Guns are everywhere. I hate them on set.\"\n\nProductions already were increasingly relying on airsoft prop guns (which simulate a slight kick with a plastic BB but do not use explosive gunpowder) and then decorating the footage in postproduction with CG muzzle flashes.\n\nLucifer co-showrunner Joe Henderson recalls a production meeting two years ago when the question occurred to him: Would it be easier and cheaper nowadays to use CG for gunfire given all the safety checks involved with using live weapons? He was surprised when the answer came back yes.\n\n\"It was a real eye-opener for me,\" Henderson recalls. \"Usually there's this assumption there will be live guns. The fact that it was more affordable and safer to use CG made it a no-brainer to change, but it's just one of those things you never think to look at. I got excited because it was one less risk and seemed like a win-win.\"\n\nFollowing the Rust tragedy, more shows are following suit. ABC's The Rookie showrunner Alexi Hawley announced Oct. 22 that the production no longer would use quarter- or half-load blanks while filming the Nathan Fillion drama. \"There will be no more 'live' weapons on the show,\" Hawley wrote. \"The safety of our cast and crew is too important. Any risk is too much risk.\"\n\nAnd a proposed new law might take the decision out of the hands of filmmakers — at least in California. Democratic State Sen. Dave Cortese issued a statement Oct. 23 saying that he plans to introduce legislation banning live ammunition and firearms from movie sets and theatrical productions. \"There is an urgent need to address alarming work abuses and safety violations occurring on the set of theatrical productions, including unnecessary high-risk conditions such as the use of live firearms,\" Cortese wrote. \"Our entertainment industry must do a better job of ensuring safe working conditions for our hardworking crews.\""}

Reid said Alec had made sure it was safe and that a child wasn't near him when they were discharging a firearm during that scene.\"\n\nRead the full affidavit, submitted Friday and now made public, below.\n\nThe detective's affidavit also notes that the film's assistant director, Dave Halls, \"did not know live rounds were in the prop gun when he had given to the prop gun to the Actor Alec Baldwin.\" Cano used the word \"rounds\" – plural – but it remains unclear from the affidavit whether there were any unfired rounds remaining in the gun.\n\nCano wrote that \"During the filming of the movie, the Assistant Director (Dave Halls) grabbed one of three 'prop-guns' that was set-up by the Armorer (Hannah Gutierrez), which was on a cart. The cart is a gray in color rolling table with two layers and was left outside of the structure due to Covid-19 restrictions.\"\n\nThe detective also noted that he \"learned one of the prop-guns was then grabbed by the assistant director (Dave Halls) and he took it to the actor identified as Alec Baldwin who was inside of the structure. As the assistant director (Dave Halls) handed the gun to the actor Alec Baldwin, (Dave Halls) yelled, 'Cold Gun,' indicating the prop-gun did not have any live rounds.\"\n\nIn his affidavit, Cano wrote that Souza \"explained that prior to the discharge of the firearm by actor Alec Baldwin, they had been working on preparing for the scene before lunch. Joel said they broke for lunch around 12:30 p.m. and had to be shuttled to an area away from the set to have breakfast, lunch and dinner. Joel (Souza) advised they returned back to the set after lunch, although he is not sure if the firearm was checked again. Joel stated they had Alec sitting in a pew in a church building setting, and he was practicing a cross draw. Joel said he was looking over the shoulder of Halyna, when he heard what sounded like a whip and then loud pop.\" Her first name was misspelled as Hayalana throughout the document.\n\nRussell (whose name was spelled \"Russel\" in the affidavit) \"said after the firearm was discharged, he remembered Joel having blood on his person, and Halyna speaking and saying she couldn't feel her legs. Reid stated once Halyna was on the ground, medics began to treat her injury as she was bleeding while on the floor of the building they were in.\""}

On the most recent season, \"American Horror Story: Double Feature,\" Grossman recalls only using rubber guns, even while shooting them.\n\n\"I even said, 'Wait, is this gonna look super fake?' And they're like, 'Oh, we can fix anything later to make it look super real.' And they did, and it looked really real,\" she said.\n\nThe deadly shooting on the set of the independent film \"Rust\" that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza involved a real firearm fired by actor Alec Baldwin that contained live rounds rather thank blanks. In the tragedy's aftermath, the industry is facing the question of whether real firearms should ever again be allowed on a set.\n\nIn response to the \"Rust\" tragedy, ABC's cop drama \"The Rookie\" banned real firearms. Eric Kripke, showrunner of Amazon's gritty superhero series \"The Boys,\" tweeted that he was taking \"a simple, easy pledge: no more guns with blanks on any of my sets ever.\"\n\nA Change.org petition to ban real guns from movie and TV productions has nearly 70,000 signatures. California state senator Dave Cortese says he plans to introduce legislation to officially ban real firearms and live ammunition from all productions, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said her state would take similar action should the entertainment industry not adopt such a ban voluntarily.\n\nBandar Albuliwi, a filmmaker and author of the Change.org petition, is incredulous that the practice of using real firearms carries on, citing deaths of actor Brandon Lee on the set of the 1993 film \"The Crow\" and camerawoman Sarah Jones on the 2014 production of \"Midnight Rider\" (unrelated to firearms) as prior examples that should have made set safety a top priority across the industry.\n\n\"This shouldn't have happened after Brandon Lee basically shot himself,\" said Albuliwi. \"Hollywood hasn't changed in 30 years. We again thought we'd learned our lesson about better protocols with 'Midnight Rider.' That caused a little stir but dissipated. This speaks volumes about our industry because, in this event, this only got attention because it involved an A-list actor like Alec Baldwin.\"\n\nCameron Kasky, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland mass shooting and gun control activist, agrees with Albuliwi. \"All real guns should be banned from sets,\" he says. \"Fake guns look very real. If studios have even the slightest regard for workers, real guns would be completely out of the question.\"\n\nFor decades, real firearms with blank ammunition have been used in film and TV productions because they visually recreate actual gunfire. But in discussions with industry insiders and visual effects experts, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, many said that advances in visual effects technology mean banning real weapons would result in virtually no sacrifice to the look and feel of a finished piece of content.\n\n\"If in the background, there's a dinosaur running around, you know, that's where the money is,\" said one longtime VFX artist. \"A couple of 'bang bang, smoky smoky' things is a sneeze compared to almost anything else.\"\n\nOften times, there is minimal lifting required in post-production to make a fake gun look as if it has been discharged, experts said. A \"muzzle flash,\" or the appearance of smoke and light from the barrel of a gun, is easily created with software used by editors and digital intermediate houses.\n\n\"Doing just a muzzle flash, it's nothing,\" says the effects artist. \"It's minutes of work per shot — maybe a tiny glow, maybe a tiny bit of interactive light.\"\n\nMore elaborate sequences involving gunfire, especially those that involve an actor flinching in reaction to an overpowering weapon, could necessitate more intensive visual effects work.\n\n\"It's essentially performance modification, and that's what would move it to the next level,\" says the artist.\n\nBut even in these cases, this artist notes these are actions an actor \"can absolutely mimic\" in their performance.\n\nTaking real firearms off a set would also remove potential lethal hazards caused by the kind of negligence that's been alleged to have occurred on \"Rust\" — from union crews walking and the hiring of scabs, to improper protocols handling weaponry. Veterans in the production coordination space, basically those in charge of \"Hollywood's back office\" as one put it, said that standard safety protocols often go overlooked, particularly on productions outside entertainment's backyard in Los Angeles.\n\n\"West Coast unions require safety classes through CSATF,\" said one top production coordinator, referring to the digital portal Contract Services, which provides training and other functions for film and TV shoots.\n\nThrough Contract Services, employees take state-mandated courses like sexual harassment education and, of course, safety training. These union-mandated program also issues daily safety bulletins with the production call sheet, briefing the entire production on the stunts and other hazards of the day.\n\n\"We're supposed to check the status of each and every union crew member before they are hired,\" says the coordinator. \"This isn't nationwide and people don't often use it.\"\n\nThese issues speak to a larger, more pernicious attitude involving on-set safety and wellbeing — and a culture of silence that has kept people from speaking up."}

For one film expert, the tragedy underscores the importance of training and oversight during sequences involving firearms.\n\n\"With the sets I work on, I work with very large crowds, up to 500 people,\" Paul Biddiss, a former British Army paratrooper turned-military advisor, told Task & Purpose. \"Weapons safety is always going to be paramount when you're working with any sort of weapon.\"\n\nBaldwin, a producer and the star of the western film \"Rust,\" fired a prop gun while filming at Bonanza Creek Ranch, in Santa Fe County, around 1:50 p.m. on Thursday, killing Halyna Hutchins, 42, the film's director of photography, and injuring director Joel Souza, 48.\n\n\"This investigation remains open and active,\" the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. \"No charges have been filed in regard to this incident. Witnesses continue to be interviewed by detectives.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported on Friday that the shooting took place during a scene that was either being actively filmed or was rehearsed.\n\n\"My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna,\" Baldwin said after the incident, adding that he was \"fully cooperating with the police investigation.\n\nSuch incidents are rare in the film industry due to extensive safety protocols typically followed during film sequences involving firearms, and has resulted in a flurry of discussion about safety measures on set when firearms are used.\n\nTo get a better sense of those safety protocols, Task & Purpose spoke with Biddiss, who served 24 years in the British Army before segueing to a career as a military advisor in film and television. Biddiss has worked on numerous action, and firearms-heavy projects, from the World War I epic \"1917\" to the crime caper \"Wrath of Man\" and \"Fury,\" which followed a tank crew in World War II.\n\nWhile some sets use prop weapons that don't fire anything at all, many of the weapons used are actual firearms that have been modified to fire only blanks, Biddiss said. Blank ammunition has all the components of a normal round, except for the projectile, and the shell casing is crimped at the round's tip.\n\nBut even though a weapon can only fire blanks, they can still be dangerous, and so film crews take extensive steps to ensure safety protocols are adhered to.\n\n\"Although they're blanks, there are still bits and pieces that will come out — sparks and bits of dust that will fly out, and some pressure,\" Bidess said. \"A blank can actually do you a huge amount of damage. If it was pressed right up against your head, it could probably kill you.\"\n\nWhen filming with semi- and fully automatic weapons that are gas-operated, meaning the combustion gas from firing a round is what reloads the weapon, the barrel typically has a mechanism called a \"restrictor.\" Restrictors function similarly to the blank-firing adapters (BFAs) used in the military, except that the device is internal, rather than attached to the exterior of the muzzle.\n\n\"They have it down the barrel to conceal that there's an actual restrictor,\" said Biddiss. \"That helps to recycle the rounds so you've got the automatic effect and the recoil and everything else.\"\n\nDevices like BFAs or restrictors do two things: they help prevent debris from escaping the barrel through the muzzle when a blank round is fired; and they help the weapon chamber another round by preventing the combustion gases from escaping the barrel."}

AFI is now accepting donations for the fund, which \"aims to help female cinematographers build sustainable careers in the movie business,\" according to director and writer Olia Oparina.\n\nOparina, who calls Hutchins \"her closest friend\" and worked with Hutchins on the 2017 film \"Snowbound\" told Variety in a statement, \"From the moment I sat down next to Halyna in UCLA extension's film directing class, I knew we would be best friends.\"\n\n\"We moved to Hollywood 11 years ago — two first generation immigrants from Ukraine and Russia who didn't know a single soul in the movie business. Instead of asking others for a seat at their table, we decided to build our own. As we worked on finishing our master's degrees, we began to find 'our tribe': a group of writers, producers and crew members that became our surrogate family. Together, we shot many projects — some of them short films, others feature-length films. No matter the scale of the project, Halyna always brought her passion and craftsmanship to each and every single one of them. Her clear vision and unique voice set her apart from all other cinematographers, as did her unquenchable thirst for cinematic knowledge. She was an inspiration and role model to anyone who had the fortune to work with her.\"\n\n\"Throughout her career, she was an advocate for female DP's and directors, familiar with the struggles women face in the entertainment industry. After overcoming many hurdles, Halyna began to get offers on big-budget films like 'Archenemy' and 'Blindfire,' features she was proud to lend her vision to. Her passing is a tragedy, not only for her family and friends, but also for the world of film she so loved, which has been forever deprived of her great talent.\"\n\nHutchins was in New Mexico shooting \"Rust,\" a Western starring Alec Baldwin, when she was shot by a prop gun that contained a live round of ammunition and died at the age of 42.\n\nShe was a rising cinematographer who was making a name for herself shooting short films and indies like \"Darlin'\" and \"Snowbound.\" The Ukraine-born Hutchins graduated from UCLA's Professional Producing program in 2010 before graduating from AFI Conservatory."}

Her death on the \"Rust\" film set is another reminder of what every injured worker knows: that \"accidental\" workplace deaths and injuries are the result of overwork, cost cutting and deliberate neglect of basic safety by management. In this case management includes the star and producer of \"Rust,\" Alec Baldwin, who fired the fatal shot that also injured director Joel Souza. The role of assistant director David Halls who handed Baldwin the loaded prop gun is under investigation as well.\n\nHutchins' death occurred during the struggle of film production workers for sufficient hours between shifts and for needed meal breaks, during recent months of 60-hour shifts on film sets. Workers on \"Rust\" were promised housing in Santa Fe, but the movie company broke that promise, and most of them were forced to drive 50 miles each way from Albuquerque to work 12-hour days.\n\nBaldwin had called in a nonunion crew to replace the IATSE members at the time of the shooting. Hutchins, a member of International Cinematographers Guild Local 600, had supported the workers. Local 480 and Local 600 held a candlelight vigil for her Oct. 24, attended by over 400 union members at the Albuquerque Civic Plaza.\n\nOne of the IATSE members at the vigil told Workers World in regards to overall exhaustion and the lack of lunch breaks: \"They give us meal penalties. If we don't break after six hours, they give us more money the longer we don't break. It's good money, but we are exhausted. We don't want the extra money anymore.\"\n\nWhat happened in Santa Fe is not an isolated incident. \"Safety on Set\" is the primary issue for the 60,000 IATSE members across the country who voted in favor of a strike earlier in October. A strike was averted when the union reached a tentative agreement with movie and television industry executives, but the contract could be rejected if members don't think it goes far enough in addressing their issues. That could lead to a strike.\n\nAs the contract vote gets underway, the tragedy in Santa Fe reminds workers of what is at stake. A countrywide IATSE strike would not be an isolated skirmish but would be another front in the current resurgence of labor militancy.\n\nWill Striketober become Strikevember?\n\nAs the month referred to as \"Striketober\" comes to a close, there are more signs of worker resistance. According to Cornell University's Labor Action Tracker, there are at least 40 U.S. strikes in progress currently — 26 of which began this month. New strikes may be on the way.\n\nAfter three years of trying to negotiate a decent contract, 350 Piedmont airlines flight attendants voted Oct. 21 to authorize a strike. After the vote dozens in Philadelphia picketed the company, a subsidiary of American Airlines. The slight wage increase management offered would be more than offset by an increase in the workers' share of health care costs."}

People joke about how cautious I am.\"\n\n\"No one is allowed to stand in the line of fire\" on his sets, he said. Advertisement\n\nNesher said he makes all his actors rehearse first using their fingers as guns before they are even allowed to touch a prop gun. The rehearsals are meant to increase safety and to make the gunfire scenes more realistic, he added.\n\n\"In America, you have these professionals who are in charge of the props and the stunt coordinators, and few know anything about real firearms,\" he said, which is why \"in Hollywood movies, so many characters shoot without aiming.\"\n\nAlthough the accident is still under investigation, Nesher said he thought it was likely that a live round of ammunition had been placed in the gun and that basic precautions were not taken.\n\nOphir Award-winning cinematographer Tobias Hochstein posted a tribute to Halyna Hutchins, the victim of the shooting, on his Facebook page: \"Sad and tragic. I'm thinking about her kid and family and friends. No excuse for live fire on a set in 2021.

I believe in Safety before everything in order to preserve life as best as we can. RIP Halyna.\"\n\nKobi Machat, who recently directed the movie Full Speed and who has used prop guns on a number of productions, echoed Nesher, saying, \"In the army, there's a saying, 'Even a broom can shoot somebody,'\" the idea being that even an innocuous object should never be pointed at a human being, much less a firearm."}

Alec Baldwin. The celebrity actor has been resting up with his family tucked away in Vermont which may surprise some.\n\nI guess Vermont is a good place to be off the radar but somehow the paparazzi got word and captured photos of the clean-shaven actor leaving a clothing store with a bag in hand, according to foxnews.com.\n\nA good place to keep low\n\nI guess Vermont is not where you would suspect Alec Baldwin to be since the tragic shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of his latest film, \"Rust.\" But maybe Vermont is the best place for him and his family. He is away from the spotlight of Hollywood or New York where he would be sure to be harassed even more.\n\nI wonder what tipped off the photographer that he was in Vermont. Foxnews.com reports that Baldwin and his family have been in the New England area since Monday, and he was first spotted picking up a food order.\n\nActor Surrounded by Controversy\n\nAlec Baldwin is a polarizing figure known for his quick temper and great impersonation of former President Donald Trump on \"SNL.\"\n\nSadly, this is not how the actor wanted to be in the news. The shooting death of Halyna Hutchins and the injury to director John Souza are still being investigated by authorities in New Mexico.\n\nBaldwin released a statement on Twitter shortly after the death that said, \"I'm fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred and I am in touch with her husband, offering my support to him and his family. My heart is broken for her husband and their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna.\"\n\nAlec Baldwin on Social Media\n\nAlec Baldwin has shared two articles on Twitter that reported the gun he fired on the set of Rust was not checked properly before it was given to him in the tragic incident that resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\n\nThe actor retweeted a Variety article on October 23rd that reported he was told the gun was safe for prop use by the film's assistant director."}

We should get her a crash pad,'\" Rodriguez recalls. \"He was like, 'No, she's not going to fall all the way.' So we had like a furniture pad instead. And she ended up fully falling over and injuring herself. A furniture pad is not a pad that you would want to fall on. You should have a crash pad. We had stunts on set. It would have taken 60 seconds.\"\n\nHalls is now under intense scrutiny after he admittedly handed Alec Baldwin a loaded Colt revolver on the set of the Western movie Rust last Thursday and declared it a \"cold gun\" — indicating it was unloaded — shortly before the actor pulled the trigger and fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\n\nIn yet another incident before he was fired from Freedom's Path, Halls allegedly failed to step in when a crew member ran into a shot to remove an errant coat and subsequently fell and injured herself to the point that she \"couldn't get up and out of the shot,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"Traditionally, that would be where the first assistant director, whose job is safety, would call 'Cut,' and then step over to make sure the person was alright. That didn't happen. My second assistant camera [operator] ended up stepping in to make sure she was alright. I cut camera on my own,\" Rodriguez recalls.\n\n\"A lot of his mentality was just, 'Get the shot. And get the shot on time.' He seemed willing to cut whatever corners were necessary to make that happen,\" Rodriguez says of Halls.\n\nRodriguez says he also was on hand the day that Halls was fired. According to producers, the termination came after a gun \"unexpectedly discharged,\" causing \"a minor and temporary injury\" to a crew member.\n\nThat incident was previously reported by CNN, but Rodriguez gives new insight into what happened that day. He says the period movie involved handmade, muzzle-loaded firearms that would be filled with enough gunpowder to cause a flash when fired."}

Entertain This!, USA TODAY\n\nColeman grew up around the film industry and around firearms, and for the past decade has worked in Wilmington and elsewhere as an on-set \"armorer.\" Armorers are tasked with making sure all weapons and firearms used on film sets are safe, and it can be illegal to use certain weapons on set without the presence of a licensed armorer.\n\nColeman said the explosion in the number of productions due to demand for streaming content, along with the stringent COVID-19 protocols that have been in place for the past year or more, have combined to create an environment on some sets where safety can become compromised.\n\nAs a result of the shooting on the \"Rust\" set, Coleman said, \"A lot of shows and studios are hitting the pause button\" in terms of using guns.\n\nHe's currently working on the Netflix shows \"Echoes\" and \"Florida Man\" in Wilmington, which Coleman said have started using \"silent blanks,\" which provide realistic recoil and weapon function, but without noise or projectiles.\n\nSome have called for an end to real guns on set altogether in the wake of the \"Rust\" shooting, arguing that CGI and other new technologies make their use unnecessary. But Coleman said there's room for a variety of approaches to the use of firearms on set, as long as safety isn't compromised.\n\nThat can be challenging at times, Coleman said.\n\n\"If I only worked with firearms, there would never be any problems. But I also work with people,\" he said. So while safety is his main concern, other factors do come into play.\n\nIn Wilmington in general, \"Things have improved dramatically since ('The Crow') in 1993,\" Coleman said, noting that there have been no major accidents locally in more than 20 years. \"But do I get complacent?

The question isn't the most important one following the accidental tragedy. Yet, it does inform the calculus on what's to come.\n\nMost observers may not care about the millions of dollars put into this indie film. Very few are considering what it would be like for anyone in the cast and crew to get back on set and finish a Western that was reportedly about halfway through production before the Oct. 21 accident. Instead, most news stories that do point toward the future are speculating about the possibility of criminal charges and the potential for civil lawsuits. Producers for the film have hired Brandon Fox at Jenner & Block to handle an investigation.\n\n\"If the facts and evidence and law support charges, then I will initiate prosecution at that time,\" Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"I do not make rash decisions and cannot rush to judgment.\"\n\nBut the choice to finish or abandon the film could very well play a role on how this all shakes out. All productions begin with several rounds of risk assessment. Investors must look at the prospect of recouping, while even the most optimistic producers take out insurance in case anything goes wrong.\n\nRust was no exception, and the film insurance policy will likely cover at least part of the tab for the shutdown and probably even the costs for defending and settling negligence claims. (Some insurers exclude gross negligence. That's a whole other discussion.) But there's certainly a limit, and that's why many banks that lend money for film and television production insist upon a completion bond.\n\nAlso called a completion guarantee, completion bonds act almost like umbrella insurance policies to fill in any gaps and get the production to the finish line.\n\nMultiple sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Rust had trouble obtaining a completion bond, which isn't unusual as premiums can be expensive — and which has become even less unusual amid the pandemic and its attendant production shutdowns.\n\nA rep for Rust did not refute THR's sources and pointed to a statement that read: \"We have halted production on the film for an undetermined period of time and are fully cooperating with all investigations and inquiries.\"\n\nBut if the film had trouble obtaining a completion bond, the absence of a financial savior also means that those with a stake in the Rust enterprise — those who put up money (the budget was reportedly $7 million to $8 million), those owed money — may eye whatever is left in the bank account plus any meager insurance proceeds and attempt to position themselves for an exit. Especially with civil claims looming, too."}

If they've already filed a 2020 return by the time the payment is sent, the IRS will base eligibility on their 2020 adjusted gross income. If not, it will be based on the 2019 return or the information submitted through an online portal set up last year for people who don't usually file tax returns.\n\nWhen can you expect the money?\n\nPeople could start seeing the payments hit their bank accounts within days of Biden signing the bill – which is expected to happen soon after the House votes on Wednesday on the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package.\n\nFor the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the IRS started sending out the second round of payments three days after then-President Donald Trump signed that legislation in late December. But it's possible that tax filing season, which is underway, could slow down the process this time.\n\nThe payments do not all go out at once.

Others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.\n\nThe IRS is \"building on lessons learned from previous rounds to increase the households that will get electronic payments, which are substantially faster than checks,\" Psaki said.\n\nYou got the last stimulus check.

Families with undocumented workers who file taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, will get a $1,000 boost if they have at least one dependent.

After receiving data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in late March, the IRS was able to start processing third stimulus payments for approximately 30 million seniors. These people will generally get their stimulus payment in the same way they get their regular Social Security benefits. Since most of these payments will be paid electronically through direct deposits or to existing Direct Express debit cards, the funds have already been delivered to many of these seniors. For those still waiting, more payments will arrive this week and in the following weeks.\n\nThird stimulus payments are generally based on information found on your 2019 or 2020 tax return. That's why many people who receive Social Security benefits and filed a 2019 or 2020 return, or who used the IRS's Non-Filers tool last year, received a third stimulus check in March. However, since some Social Security recipients don't file tax returns, the IRS didn't have the necessary information in its computer systems to process third-round stimulus payments for them. That's why the tax agency needed data from the SSA to send out checks to seniors who haven't file a recent tax return.\n\nIn addition to seniors receiving Social Security retirement benefits, payments are also being sent to people receiving Social Security disability (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits who didn't file a 2019 or 2020 tax return or didn't use the Non-Filers tool. Veterans who receive benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs but didn't file a recent tax return should start getting third-round stimulus payments soon, too.\n\nMost Social Security, SSDI, SSI, and RRB beneficiaries who are eligible for a third stimulus check don't need to take any action to receive a payment (not everyone is eligible). However, as with previous stimulus payments, some beneficiaries may need to file a 2020 tax return – even if they don't usually file – to provide the IRS the information it needs to send an additional $1,400 for a spouse or any dependents. The deadline for filing a 2020 tax return has been pushed back from April 15 to May 17, 2021.\n\nAmount of Your Third Stimulus Check\n\nEvery eligible American will receive a $1,400 third stimulus check \"base amount.\" The base amount jumps to $2,800 for married couples filing a joint tax return.

Here's what to know\n\nThe offers mentioned below are no longer available.\n\nAt least 90 million stimulus checks went out last week as part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, but there are still many Americans waiting on their first two checks.\n\nAnyone eligible for a check who hasn't received their stimulus money from 2020 will receive the cash in the form of Recovery Rebate Credits once they file their 2020 federal taxes. However, if you're behind on certain debts, including child support and back taxes, you may get a smaller tax return than you expect depending on how much you owe.\n\nWhile the CARES Act only made the first $1,200 stimulus exempt from state and federal garnishment (with the exception of child support), the terms of the $900 billion Covid relief bill passed in December protected the second round of stimulus checks from garnishment by all creditors, including private ones.\n\nHowever, tax refunds are treated differently. If you're getting your stimulus payment in the form of a tax rebate, the amount may be reduced to pay debts owed.

However, the money may be garnished for unpaid private debts, such as medical bills or credit card debts, provided they are subject to a court order. And like with 2020 taxes, if you get your $1,400 stimulus check in the form of a tax rebate, the same offsets above could be possible.\n\nSome consumer advocacy and banking groups are calling on Congress to pass a standalone bill to make the latest stimulus payment exempt from garnishment. In a joint letter by the American Bankers Association, Americans for Financial Reform and other groups, consumer advocates argue that allowing garnishment impacts struggling families the most and fails to carry out the objective of stimulus payments in the first place.\n\nIf you're still awaiting your third stimulus payment, you may track it using the IRS Get My Payment site."}

The latest stimulus package, the American Rescue Plan, includes up to a $1,400 stimulus check for eligible individuals, $2,800 for married or joint filers, and $1,400 for dependents. If you didn't get a third stimulus check, here's why. If there is a fourth stimulus check, however, it could look different than the previous three stimulus checks. There are many ways for Congress to give people more money from Washington. Here are some options:\n\n1. Send $2,000 stimulus check every month\n\nMore than 75 members of Congress want to give you $2,000 stimulus checks every month until the Covid-19 pandemic is over. Under this proposal, you could get a recurring stimulus check every month until the economy recovers. The rationale is that a one-time stimulus check is insufficient for most Americans who are struggling financially as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. In January, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and 55 Democrats sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to support further stimulus checks. However, Biden doesn't support recurring stimulus checks nor are there enough votes in Congress to pass $2,000 a month stimulus checks. There are many reasons why a 4th stimulus check is unlikely. For example, Biden is focused on passing his new infrastructure package, and that stimulus package doesn't include any one-time or recurring stimulus checks. However, Congress could add a stimulus check before passing the legislation, although the likelihood is low.\n\n2. Make the child tax credit permanent\n\nBiden proposed giving $300 checks every month for people with children. This equates to up to a $3,600 cash allowance for children under age 6. There's also up to a $3,000 cash allowance for children ages 6 to 17, which equates to a $250 check every month. This change, which is included in the last stimulus package, changes the prior child tax credit of up to $2,000 annually. However, the $300 checks every month are only temporary. Rather than provide monthly or recurring Economic Impact Payments, Congress could make the temporary child tax credit permanent. Biden supports extending these recurring checks, while other members of Congress want the child tax credit to become permanent.\n\n3. Give parents $1,000 checks every month\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) proposed new legislation this week that would create the Parent Tax Credit, a tax cut up to $12,000 per year, which is intended to help working parents start a family and raise children. Hawley's plan would enable parents to care for their children at home, rather than hire a commercial childcare provider, and still qualify for the tax cut. Congress could pass this legislation instead of stimulus checks. To qualify, you need at least one child under age 13 and you must work at least 20 hours per week and earn at least the minimum wage. There would be no income phase out. If Congress passes this legislation, this tax cut would be in addition to the child tax credit.\n\n4. Congress could extend unemployment insurance\n\nSupplemental federal unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire in September. Currently, per the latest stimulus package, you can get $300 a week of supplemental federal unemployment insurance. Congress could extend this temporary benefit and help provide additional, direct stimulus to millions of unemployed Americans. If Congress extends supplemental unemployment insurance, this benefit would act as a recurring stimulus check for a targeted group of individuals.\n\n5.

Those same people could have also been left out of the $600 checks that were issued in December.\n\nThe Treasury Department can help rectify this by creating online tools for this population to claim their payments and establishing outreach efforts to let people know they could qualify for the money.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nAlmost 3 million fell off unemployment benefits cliff\n\nStates will give out $25 billion in rent aid.

It was simpler than a tax return. At the same time, the government also launched a media campaign and sent letters to 9 million people to let them know they could qualify for checks.\n\nAt a hearing last fall, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig estimated that 8 million eligible people still had not used the non-filer portal.\n\nAnd the number of people who are missing checks could be even bigger today, Jacoby said."}

Here's how to track yours.\n\nWhile major banks in the U.S. started delivering $1,400 stimulus checks in March, the federal relief payments continue to arrive at millions of households struggling to make ends meet amid the coronavirus-hobbled economy.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has delivered more than 165 million payments, with a total value of approximately $388 billion, the agency said Wednesday. The latest round includes 1 million payments, with the IRS noting they have an official payment date of May 12. That means the most recent recipients will receive a direct deposit on Wednesday, or soon get a paper check or pre-paid debit card in the mail.\n\nThe timing and delivery of checks has been a cause of anxiety for some people, especially for those who receive government benefits such as Social Security and don't typically file taxes. The IRS prioritized sending checks to people who have already filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns, since the agency was able to quickly verify eligibility based on income and also determine where to mail or direct deposit the checks.\n\nFollowing that initial distribution of checks, the IRS vetted payment data for government benefit recipients, with recipients of Social Security benefits among those still receiving their checks. On Wednesday, the IRS said the payments arriving this week include more than 460,000 \"plus-up\" payments for people who were owed more stimulus funds than they initially received.\n\nThe agency said it's sending another 500,000 payments to eligible people who recently filed a tax return but for whom it didn't previously have information to issue a stimulus check.\n\nAbout half of the newly issued checks were sent via direct deposit, with the other half sent through the mail via paper checks or pre-paid debit cards, the IRS said.\n\nFourth stimulus check?\n\nSome lawmakers are pushing for a fourth round of payments even as the IRS continues to distribute the third stimulus checks. One year after the pandemic shut down the U.S. economy, millions of people continue to experience financial hardship. About 38% of people said their household income remains impacted by the crisis, according to a study from TransUnion, a financial services firm.\n\nThat represents a significant decline from a year earlier, when about 6 in 10 people said their household income had taken a hit, but it continues to show the ongoing struggles facing many Americans, said Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion.\n\n\"It's material improvement, but it indicates over one-third of consumers are continuing to feel some sort of financial impact,\" Wise told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's a big deal.\""}

To date, the focus has been on how a stimulus package will impact consumer spending, but it is not clear how President Joe Biden's proposed $1,400 stimulus check for eligible households will affect Americans' ability to pay their bills.\n\nConventional economic data such as gross domestic product and high-frequency consumer spending data both measure economic output. Similarly, aggregate personal saving data offers no insight into the distribution of savings across the population. While these data sources offer important insight into the likely impact of fiscal spending on the economy, they only tell part of the story.\n\nTo assess the impact, amount and eligibility of a third stimulus package, Morning Consult analyzed its proprietary tracking data on household finances, which offers insight into the current condition of households' balance sheets.\n\nUsing this data, this analysis argues that a third round of $1,400 stimulus checks more narrowly targeted to low-income adults and parents combined with enhancements to the country's unemployment benefit system would prevent unnecessary financial hardship and mitigate future economic risks.\n\n$1,400 would help many Americans avoid financial hardship through July\n\nThe purpose of fiscal spending during a recession is not only to boost short-term economic activity; it's also to provide financially vulnerable households with enough money to avoid unnecessary financial harm. As a society, delinquencies and defaults are inefficient and costly uses of resources, and financial uncertainty prevents families from investing in their futures.

You can sign into your IRS account (or create one) to see how much you have been paid already in order to correctly determine your outstanding balance.\n\nThe IRS should have also sent you two documents detailing the amount of your payments: Notice 1444 which provides information on your first payment and Notice 1444-B which shows how much your second payment was for.\n\nOnce you've calculated your credit and submitted a tax return requesting the unpaid funds, the IRS will also calculate the amount of the credit they believe you are due. If the amount you requested in stimulus funds doesn't match up with what the agency expects to pay, this can result in a small delay in the processing of your refund.\n\nNo IRS stimulus check?: If you haven't gotten the third COVID-19 relief payment, you're not completely out of luck\n\nIf the IRS adjusts the amount of stimulus money you'll receive after you've filed your returns, you will receive a letter from the agency explaining the discrepancy and why the IRS corrected the amount."}

Here's Why\n\nEditorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.\n\nNow that the third round of pandemic relief stimulus checks has been long spent, you might wonder if there's any potential for a fourth round of payments.\n\nIn short, no. However, a few states have opted to issue payments of their own.\n\nLawmakers instead are focusing on other measures to provide financial support, like child tax credit payments.\n\nDirect payments and other pandemic relief programs have been shown to curb housing and food insecurity during the pandemic. Without them, it's likely the economic recovery after the early pandemic recession in spring 2020 would move even slower than the gradual progress it's been making for the last year and a half.\n\nBut although some members of Congress have previously called for additional aid for households still weathering the financial effects of the pandemic, there have not been meaningful discussions at the federal level about issuing another round of checks.\n\nWhat States Are Sending New Stimulus Checks?\n\nMany states have either sent, or are sending, stimulus checks to qualifying residents.\n\nCalifornia\n\nIn July, California announced the Golden Gate Stimulus deal to provide a payment to 5.7 million people. Taxpayers earning between $30,000 and $75,000 per year can receive one-time payments of $600, and households with dependents can receive an additional $500. Distribution of those payments began in September.\n\nNew York\n\nIn April, New York started offering one-time payments of up to $15,000 for undocumented immigrants who couldn't work due to the pandemic. Applications are considered in the order received, and the state has cautioned that the fund is nearly empty.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNew Mexico announced one-time payments of $750 to more than 4,000 low-income households that didn't receive federal stimulus payments. Applications for this program are no longer accepted, and payments were issued in early August.\n\nMaryland\n\nIn Maryland, taxpayers with qualifying income could receive up to $500. Those payments were authorized and processed in February 2021.\n\nColorado\n\nIn Colorado, anyone who received unemployment benefits between March and October 2020 automatically received a one-time payment of $375.\n\nOther State Programs\n\nOther states have chosen to send direct payments to certain groups of frontline workers. Some teachers in Georgia and Florida received payments in 2021; in Minnesota, those receiving bonus checks included grocery store workers and medical center staffers.\n\nIn some cases, additional direct payments have come from state budgets: California's, for one, was funded by a surplus in state income tax revenue. Other state programs have used federal pandemic aid to distribute money to residents directly.\n\nIs Congress Calling for a Fourth Stimulus Payment?\n\nDiscussion on Capitol Hill about issuing additional stimulus payments has quieted since the spring.\n\nIn late March, a group of more than 20 Democratic senators signed a letter to Biden asking for additional aid for Americans. The group recommended recurring direct payments instead of a one-time check."}

The White House's massive $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus and rapidly improving public health are unleashing pent-up demand.\n\n\"While we aren't completely out of the woods yet, today's report shows the beginning of an economic rebound,\" said Brendan Coughlin, head of consumer banking at Citizens in Boston. \"Assuming no setback in the continued rollout of the vaccines, U.S. consumers are well-positioned in the second half of the year to stimulate strong economic growth across the country.\"\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 4.2% last month after falling 1.0% in February, the Commerce Department said. The increase was broadly in line with economists' expectations.\n\nThe data was included in Thursday's gross domestic product report for the first quarter, which showed growth shooting up at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first three months of the year after rising at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending powered ahead at a 10.7% rate last quarter.\n\nMost Americans in the middle- and low-income brackets received one-time $1,400 stimulus checks last month which were part of the pandemic rescue package approved in March. That boosted personal income 21.1% after a drop of 7.0% in February.\n\nA chunk of the cash was stashed away, with the saving rate soaring to 27.6% from 13.9% in February. Households have amassed at least $2.2 trillion in excess savings, which could provide a powerful tailwind for consumer spending this year and beyond.\n\nThe government's generosity and expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to include all American adults is lifting consumer spirits, with a measure of household sentiment rising to a 13-month high in April.\n\nWages are also increasing, which should to help to underpin spending when stimulus boost fades.\n\nIn a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, jumped 0.9% in the first quarter. That was the largest rise since the second quarter of 2007.\n\nThe ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Last quarter's increase was driven by a 1.0% rise in wages, also the biggest gain in 14 years.\n\nWages in the accommodation and food services industry, hardest hit by the pandemic, soared 1.7%.\n\nDespite employment being 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020, businesses are struggling to find qualified workers as they rush to meet the robust domestic demand.\n\nU.S. stocks were lower after a recent rally. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.\n\nINFLATION RISING\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the worker shortage saying \"one big factor would be schools aren't open yet, so there's still people who are at home taking care of their children, and would like to be back in the workforce, but can't be yet.\""}

Cumulatively, Americans have received more than $850 billion of Economic Impact Payments from three different stimulus packages in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to new research, here's how most Americans have spent their stimulus checks and how stimulus checks have impacted the economy.\n\nHow did Americans spend their stimulus checks?\n\nThe answer: it depends.\n\nFirst stimulus check: Cares Act\n\nFor the first stimulus check, almost 75% used, or planned to use, their stimulus payments for household expenses. Why? The first stimulus check was mostly disbursed in April 2020 when the unemployment rate was 14.7% and there was greater uncertainty about the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSecond stimulus check and third stimulus checks\n\nHowever, the spending patterns changed for the second and third stimulus checks. For example, approximately 20% spent or planned to spend their stimulus checks on essential expenses such as food and housing. Americans instead chose to use their Economic Impact Payments to save for retirement or pay off debt. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, here's how the Americans spend their second stimulus check (Consolidation Appropriations Act) and third stimulus check (American Rescue Plan) compared to the first stimulus check:\n\nFirst Stimulus Check: Spend (74%), Save (14%), Pay Debt (11%)\n\nSpend (74%), Save (14%), Pay Debt (11%) Second Stimulus Check: Spend (22%), Save (26%), Pay Debt (51%)\n\nSpend (22%), Save (26%), Pay Debt (51%) Third Stimulus Check: Spend (19%), Save (32%), Pay Debt (49%)\n\nHow Americans spent their stimulus checks Peter G. Peterson Foundation per The U.S. Census Bureau data\n\nHow income level affected stimulus checks\n\nThe first, second and third stimulus checks reached an estimated 85% of households. Stimulus payments targeted lower income and middle income households, with a gradual decline for households earning more than $75,000 annually. The amount of an individual's income impacted how they spent their stimulus payment. While all income levels were more likely to spend their first stimulus check, higher income individuals were more likely to save their stimulus check. This is particularly true in the second and third stimulus checks. For example, in comparison to spending on essential expenses, households that earned more than $150,000 annually were more likely to both save their stimulus check and use their stimulus check to pay off debt. Lower income and middle income households, according to the researchers, may have been less willing to save or pay off debt due to uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHave stimulus checks helped the economy?\n\nThe research is inconclusive how much stimulus checks have helped the economy. That said, Economic Impact Payments \"may have contributed to a rise in\" personal income, consumer spending, personal savings and economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the stimulus checks under the Cares Act increased economic output in the U.S. by 0.6%. In comparison, enhanced unemploymentt benefits boosted the economy by 1.1%, while the Payment Protection Program (PPP) led to an increase of 0.8%."}

In some cases, we receive a commission from our partners; however, our opinions are our own.\n\nI've been answering questions about stimulus checks on Twitter, including whether former dependents are eligible.\n\nIf you meet the qualifications, you can get the stimulus money after filing your 2020 tax return.\n\nThis applies to both rounds of payments, totaling a maximum of $1,800 per person.\n\nQuestion: I was claimed as a dependent in 2019, but I'm filing my own tax return for 2020 — can I get a stimulus check?\n\nAnswer: Yes, as long as you meet the income requirements and have a Social Security number.\n\nAdult dependents — including college students and retirees — were left out of the stimulus check legislation passed in March and December of 2020, but there's a way to settle the score on your 2020 tax return. (The third stimulus check goes to individuals with qualifying dependents of any age.)\n\nDuring the initial disbursal of checks, no person over age 16 who was claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return could get a payment.\n\nBecause Congress directed the Treasury Department to use Americans' 2019 or 2018 tax return (whichever was most recently filed) to determine eligibility, it didn't entirely account for financial need in 2020, when the coronavirus gripped the US.\n\nHere's what I mean: Consider a 23-year-old who was claimed as a dependent on their parents' tax return in 2019. They graduated college in early 2020, but struggled to hold a job during the pandemic and could have used the relief check. Since the most recent return filed with the IRS listed the student as a 22-year-old dependent, their parents received no child stimulus payment (the dependent needed to be 16 or younger) and the student received no payment of their own.\n\nI'm certain there are many versions of this scenario, but all you need to know is this: If a parent, guardian, or relative is not going to claim you as a dependent for 2020 — and legally cannot — then you can collect any missing stimulus money when you file your own tax return. You won't get the money immediately, but it'll be added to your refund. The IRS delivers most refunds within three weeks.\n\nWhen does a student qualify as a dependent? They are under age 24 and enrolled full-time in college (at least five months) on the last day of the year OR they're under age 19\n\nAND they provided less than 50% of their own financial support during the year (scholarships are not considered student-provided support)\n\nHow to claim a stimulus check on your 2020 taxes\n\nA stimulus check is technically a refundable tax credit called the Recovery Rebate Credit. Both rounds of stimulus payments are combined into one credit. The third stimulus check is treated separately.\n\nA tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your tax bill. A $1,000 credit, for example, cuts your tax bill by $1,000. Some tax credits are refundable, meaning if you don't have a tax bill large enough to use the full credit, you get the money as a refund. That's how the recovery rebate credit works. But in order to get the credit, you have to file a federal tax return, even if your income is too low to be taxable.\n\nQualifications for a 1st or 2nd stimulus check: You have a Social Security number, or you have a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and are married to a person with a Social Security number.\n\nYou meet the income limits.\n\nYou are not claimed as a dependent on another tax return for 2020.\n\nYou file a tax return for 2020 and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit."}

The centerpiece of the law was an emergency payment to over 150 million American households that needed help.\n\nCongress used a simple filter to determine who was eligible for assistance: The full $1,200 was limited to single taxpayers who'd reported $75,000 a year or less in income on their previous tax return. Married couples got $2,400 if they had reported less than $150,000 in income. Money was sent automatically to those who qualified.\n\nIra Rennert, worth $3.7 billion according to Forbes, did not appear to need the cash infusion offered by the CARES Act. After all, his 62,000-square-foot Hamptons home is one of the largest in the country, so he was unlikely to get cabin fever during lockdown, let alone have trouble buying food. Nevertheless, Rennert, who made his fortune as a corporate raider in the '80s and '90s, got a $2,400 check from the government.\n\nGeorge Soros, the prominent hedge fund manager and philanthropist who's worth $8.6 billion, didn't need the CARES cash, either. Neither did his son, Robert, himself worth hundreds of millions. But they, too, both got checks. (Both returned the checks, according to their representatives.)\n\nProPublica, using its trove of IRS records, identified at least 18 billionaires who received stimulus payments, which were funded by U.S. taxpayers, in the spring of 2020. Hundreds of other ultrawealthy taxpayers also got checks.\n\nThe wealthy taxpayers who received the stimulus checks got them because they came in under the government's income threshold. In fact, they reported way less taxable income than that — even hundreds of millions less — after they used business write-offs to wipe out their gains.\n\nProPublica found 270 taxpayers who collectively disclosed $5.7 billion in income, according to their previous tax return, but who were able to deploy deductions at such a massive scale that they qualified for stimulus checks. All listed negative net incomes on tax returns.\n\nConsider two stimulus recipients with similarly huge incomes in 2018. Timothy Headington is an oil mogul, real estate developer and executive producer of such films as \"Argo\" and \"World War Z,\" and he's worth $1.4 billion. He had $62 million in income in 2018, but after $342 million in write-offs, his final result was negative $280 million. The same was true of Rennert, whose $64 million in income that year was erased by $355 million in deductions, for a final total of negative $291 million.\n\nFigures like these reveal a basic truth about the U.S. income tax system. Most people earn the overwhelming majority of their income via wages and take deductions where they can. But the income of the ultrawealthy as revealed on their taxes tells, at best, a partial story. As ProPublica reported earlier this year, the wealthiest taxpayers often have great flexibility in when and how they take taxable income, allowing them to pay a minuscule portion of their wealth growth in taxes. For the ultrawealthy, wages are to be avoided, carrying as they do the burden of not only income tax but also of payroll taxes.\n\nWages rarely made up a significant portion of income for the 270 wealthy stimulus check recipients identified by ProPublica. In total, only $82 million, or 1.4%, of the $5.7 billion in income taken in by the group came in the form of wages.\n\nThe ultrawealthy have other tax advantages. Many can tap a particularly generous vein of deductions: businesses they own. These can wipe out all of their income, even for years to come, unlike other deductions, like those for charitable giving. Certain industries, like real estate or oil and gas, are a well-known source of tax benefits that can generate paper losses even for a successful business."}

The IRS said it has delivered more than 8 million of the supplemental payments this year.\n\nAnother 900,000 payments went out over the past two weeks to people whom the IRS did not previously have enough information for but who recently filed tax returns. Many of those are very low-income people who aren't normally required to file tax returns because their incomes fall below the filing threshold. They were encouraged to file this year to claim the stimulus money they are eligible for.\n\nThe IRS will continue to send out \"plus-up\" payments to those who recently filed tax returns on a weekly basis. More than 169 million households have received stimulus money this year to date.\n\nWho gets a third stimulus payment?\n\nThe third round of payments, which was authorized by Congress in March, are worth up to $1,400 per person and expected to reach 85% of households, according to the White House.\n\nFamilies will receive an additional $1,400 per dependent, so a couple with two children could get up to $5,600. Unlike prior rounds, families will receive the additional money for adult dependents over the age of 17.\n\nThe full amount goes to individuals earning less than $75,000 of adjusted gross income, heads of households (like single parents) earning less than $112,500 and married couples earning less than $150,000. Then the payments gradually phase out as income goes up.\n\nIndividuals who earn at least $80,000 a year of adjusted gross income, heads of households who earn at least $120,000 and married couples who earn at least $160,000 are completely cut off – regardless of how many children they have.\n\nMore cash on the way for families with children\n\nThe latest pandemic aid package also increased the size of the child tax credit and called for it to be sent out in periodic payments that will begin to go out on July 15.\n\nThe IRS has started sending letters notifying more than 36 million families who, based on tax returns, may be eligible for the child tax credit payments. Most won't have to do anything to receive the money, which will be based on information provided on the 2020 or 2019 tax returns. An online portal will be made available later in the summer that will allow families to update information regarding their incomes, number of children and bank accounts.\n\nThose payments will technically be an advance on a 2021 tax credit. Eligible parents will receive $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child under age 18. Until now, the credit was up to only $2,000 per child under age 17. At least half of the amount will go out over the summer and the remainder will be lumped in with next year's tax refund.\n\nThe enhanced portion of the credit will be available for single parents with annual incomes up to $75,000 and joint filers making up to $150,000 a year.\n\nCongress also made the child tax credit fully refundable so more low-income families can benefit. Previously, if the credit exceeded the taxes owed, parents could receive only up to $1,400 as a refund. These households also must have earned income of at least $2,500. The change could make 20 million more children eligible."}

That compared to the Dow Jones estimate of a 6.1% gain and a decline of 2.7% in February.\n\nSporting goods, clothing and food and beverage led the gains in spending and contributed to the best month for retail since the May 2020 gain of 18.3%, which came after the first round of stimulus checks. A separate report showed first-time filings for unemployment insurance plunged, with the Labor Department reporting 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ended April 10.

While there's some support from Democratic lawmakers for recurring payments, the party has slim majorities in the House and Senate and limiting the third round of payments was a key priority for moderates during negotiations of the latest pandemic relief package passed in March.\n\nInstead, lawmakers are focused on a massive infrastructure bill that could be taken up this summer. A bipartisan-backed outline of the package released last week does not include any direct payments. President Joe Biden is also pushing Congress to pass his American Families Plan, but that doesn't call for a fourth round of stimulus payments, either. Instead, it calls for making community college free, child care more affordable and provide guaranteed paid sick and family leave.\n\nBut there's still some pandemic aid already approved by Congress making its way to American families. The Internal Revenue Service is making payment adjustments for people who lost income during 2020 and are due more money than they originally received, and some families are set to receive advanced payments of the expanded child tax credit.

If not, it will be based on the 2019 return or the information submitted through an online portal set up last year for people who don't usually file tax returns.\n\nWhen can you expect the money?\n\nPeople could start seeing the payments hit their bank accounts within days of President Joe Biden signing the bill.\n\nFor the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the IRS started sending out the second round of payments three days after then-President Donald Trump signed that legislation in late December. But it's possible that tax filing season, which is underway, could slow down the process this time.\n\nYou got the last stimulus check. Will you get this one?\n\nThe payments do not all go out at once. Those whose bank information is on file with the IRS would likely get the money first, because it would be directly deposited into their accounts. Others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.\n\nNot necessarily. While the same people who received the full amounts in the previous two rounds of stimulus payments will likely get the full amount this time, the checks will phase out faster now – cutting off people at a lower income level.\n\nThe first round, which was worth up to $1,200, excluded individuals who earned at least $99,000, head of household filers with one child who earned more than $136,500 and married couples without children earning more than $198,000 – but families earning a little more were still eligible if they had children. About 160 million payments were delivered, with 94% of families receiving the money.\n\nThe second round, which was worth up to $600, also phased out a little faster because the full amount was smaller. It phased out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children. Again, those earning a little more were still eligible if they had children. About 158 million payments went out, with 92% of families receiving them.\n\nThe payments have been based on a taxpayer's most recent tax return. So those who have filed new returns since last March could fall into or out of eligibility if their incomes changed.\n\nWho else isn't eligible?\n\nUndocumented immigrants who don't have Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the payments. But their spouses and children are eligible as long as they have Social Security numbers. They were excluded from the first round.\n\nWill you owe back some money to the IRS if you earned more in 2020?\n\nNo. If your 2019 income was less than your pay in 2020 you will not owe back any money.\n\nBut if your income fell in 2020, filing your tax return now – before the payments go out – may mean you'll get a bigger check."}

Most recently, rumors were flying on the internet about a fourth stimulus check being disbursed by the federal government this week of up to $7,000.

Check the mail for a debit card.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service sent out more than 100 million payments in January, which were approved by Congress late last year. The vast majority of payments were directly deposited into personal bank accounts, but others are receiving either a paper check or prepaid debit card in the mail. About 8 million debit cards were sent out.\n\nLike the first round of payments, which were worth up to $1,200 per person and were sent out last spring, the agency is sending the payment in three different ways to help speed up the delivery process.\n\nLast year, some recipients mistakenly thought the debit cards were junk mail. The Internal Revenue Service is warning people to keep a careful eye on the mail and that the form of payment may be different than the one received last year. Some people who received a paper check last time may now get a prepaid debit card. The new payment will not be added to any debit cards that were sent for the first round of payments.\n\nThe debit cards are being sent in a white envelope with the Treasury Department seal on the outside. The card itself is a Visa debit card issued by MetaBank, the Treasury's financial agent. It can be used to make purchases, to get cash at an ATM or to transfer funds into a bank account without being charged a fee.\n\nPeople can check to see whether their second payment has been sent by using the Internal Revenue Service's Get My Payment online tool. The law required the agency to stop delivering this round of payments. Eligible people who weren't sent their money by then will have to wait to claim it on their 2020 tax return.\n\nEligibility is largely based on income. Individuals earning less than $75,000 a year will receive the full $600. Heads of household earning less than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning less than $150,000 are also due the full amount. They will receive $600 per child under the age of 17, which is $100 more than in the first round.\n\nThe payments start phasing out for people making more money, at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income. Some people who received the first payment may be phased out of the second round because the payments are smaller.\n\nThey will phase out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.\n\nUndocumented immigrants who don't have Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the payments.

Instead, the new stimulus package included $1,400 stimulus checks for individuals and $2,800 for married and joint filers. Several Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives highlighted the discrepancy between what was apparently \"promised\" ($2,000 stimulus checks) and what was \"delivered\" ($1,400 stimulus checks).

The first batch, amounting to 600,000 payments, went out Aug. 27, and the second batch, on Sept. 17, was much larger, with at least 2 million Californians receiving the benefit. Approximately two-thirds of California taxpayers are eligible for a payment of $600, and some qualifying families will receive an additional $500.\n\nThese state-only checks are part of the $100 billion \"California Comeback Plan\" aimed at providing immediate relief to families and business that've been the most negatively impacted by the pandemic. Gov. Gavin Newsom's office called it \"the biggest state tax rebate in American history.\"\n\nRead on to find out if you'll be getting a Golden State Stimulus II check, what you need to do to get your money, and when your check could arrive. Also, here's everything you need to know about the 2021 child tax credit, which is providing the vast majority of families across the US with advance monthly checks to help cover expenses and basic necessities.\n\nDo I qualify for a $600 or $1,100 payment?\n\nThe Golden State Stimulus II payments are different from the Golden State Stimulus I payments that went out earlier this year. GSS I payments -- a one-time check of either $600 or $1,200 -- went out to those who typically earned less than $30,000 and received the state's Earned Income Tax Credit, or CalEITC, or those who filed their taxes with an Individual Tax Identification Number, or ITIN.\n\nGSS II has been expanded so that more Californians qualify. You're eligible for a $600 payment if you've been a California resident for more than half of the 2020 tax year (you must still be a California resident on the date the payment is issued). You need to also meet the following requirements:\n\nYou filed your 2020 taxes by Oct. 15, 2021.\n\nYour California Adjusted Gross Income, or CA AGI, was $75,000 or less for the 2020 tax year.\n\nYou cannot be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer.\n\nIf you don't qualify for GSS II, see if you might be eligible for GSS I. Californians who received the earlier GSS I payment could be eligible for a GSS II check for $500 or $1,000 only if they claimed a qualifying child or relative as a dependent on their 2020 tax return.\n\nBesides those who already received GSS I and have no dependents, there are others who are excluded from GSS II payments. Californians whose income is exclusively from other benefits, like Social Security, CalWorks, unemployment or state disability, do not qualify. For more information, check out the Franchise Tax Board's help page.\n\nWatch this: Child tax credit: Everything we know 04:17\n\nHow much money will I get?\n\nFor most Californians who qualify, you do not need to do anything to receive GSS II other than file your 2020 tax return. If you still need to file, you can find different options for filing online, on paper or in person before the deadline on Oct. 15,\n\nIf you'd like to see if you qualify, or estimate the amount of your GSS II, you can go to the Franchise Tax Board estimator. If you have a Social Security number and meet all the GSS II requirements above, you should receive $600 if you had no dependents, and $1,100 if you claimed at least one dependent. Note that some of the payment amounts change depending on whether you received GSS I, whether you have an SSN or ITIN and if you are married filing separately.\n\nWhen will my stimulus payment be sent?\n\nCalifornia's stimulus payments are going out twice a month, or about every two weeks, though some may go out earlier or later. Those who qualify and have already set up direct deposit when filing their 2020 tax return can expect an electronic payment.\n\nMost direct deposit stimulus payments will be issued before Oct. 31. If you filed a state tax return after Sept. 1, you might have to wait at least 45 days for the return to be processed and have a check issued."}

Here's why\n\nThousands of Americans living abroad received stimulus checks during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to federal data. While that may sound incongruous with the notion of \"stimulus\" for the U.S. economy, lawmakers generally had a sound rationale for sending funds overseas, according to tax policy experts. \"They are casting a very broad net and [payments may] go to places where people think, 'Did they really need to go there?'\" said Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"But I think the answer is generally, 'Yes.'\" More from Invest in You:\n\nThese companies have a 4-day workweek.

The figures include three rounds of pandemic-era payments through June 3, 2021. (Additional payments may have been sent since then.) The data encompasses U.S. citizens abroad, military members stationed overseas and residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico. (While U.S. territories aren't \"overseas\" in the sense that foreign countries are, the IRS doesn't report these statistics separately.)\n\nLess than 1%\n\nAbout 9 million U.S. citizens live overseas, according to the U.S. Department of State. It's natural many of them would get checks due to the expansive eligibility framework set by Congress, Pomerleau said. The scope of the overseas payments is also small relative to the total — 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively, of the $803 billion and 472 million payments issued over three rounds of funding. \"The scale of the payments going overseas is less than 1% of the [total],\" Pomerleau said. \"It wasn't really very much when you look at it.\"\n\nCongress authorized the IRS to send stimulus checks three times during the pandemic: in March 2020 (up to $1,200 a person), last December ($600) and this past March ($1,400). The funds are technically advance payments of a refundable tax credit (the recovery rebate credit). The advance payments are called Economic Impact Payments — the legislative terminology for what Americans have come to call \"stimulus checks.\" But the term \"stimulus checks\" is somewhat of a misnomer, according to tax policy experts. The term implies lawmakers aimed to stimulate demand for goods and services in the U.S. economy by sending money to households. But it seems Congress' primary intent was to buoy household finances at a time of mass unemployment and financial hardship, according to policy experts."}

She usually has to criss-cross the picturesque region by bus to find discounts at Dollar Tree, Grocery Outlet and Walmart.\n\nSo when she learned about Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to send $600 payments to the lowest income Californians in February, Clendenin felt relief.\n\nThen came frustration.\n\nClendenin scoured the news for details on eligibility. She learned that she could have qualified if she worked in 2020. But a constellation of diabetes, arthritis, migraines, back injuries and nerve pain made work impossible about six years ago. Given her disabilities, she could also have qualified if only she received Supplemental Security Income, a federal safety-net program for elderly, blind and disabled people with limited income.\n\nBut nowhere could Clendenin find mention of Social Security Disability Insurance, the other main federal program for people with disabilities, which sends her $1,056 a month.\n\n\"I couldn't believe that we were left out,\" said Clendenin. \"How unfair is that?\"\n\nIt's a sentiment shared by many Californians on federal disability insurance, who have asked why Newsom's stimulus payments skipped them over.\n\nWhile California lawmakers automatically sent checks to 1.2 million people who receive SSI, the 1.2 million Californians on SSDI only qualify if they had income from work in 2020. But that's rare — research shows that fewer than one in five SSDI recipients work during a typical year, often because they are limited by their disabilities or risk losing their benefits if they work too much.\n\nDisability advocates say it's the latest example of the state abandoning some of its most vulnerable residents during the pandemic, after having directed medical health providers to ration COVID-19 care to elderly and less healthy people last spring and deprioritize people with disabilities for vaccines earlier this year — both policies that were reversed after considerable outcry.\n\n\"Overall the state has been uneven in how it's helped people with disabilities navigate the pandemic,\" said Andrew Imparato, executive director of Disability Rights California. \"A lot of people with disabilities have had to fend for themselves.\"\n\nDepartment of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer cites logistical challenges. California maintains an up-to-date list of residents who get SSI because the state supplements the federal benefit by a few hundred dollars, but doesn't have access to the same information for SSDI.\n\n\"Trying to include SSDI... would be a time-consuming and laborious process with the feds that doesn't line up with the intent of (the Golden State Stimulus) — to get immediate relief to Californians with whom we have an existing relationship,\" Palmer wrote in an email.\n\n'Make hard decisions quickly'\n\nThe Newsom administration may have also based the decision on a consideration of need.\n\nCalifornia's SSI recipients live in poverty by definition. Elderly, blind and disabled people can only qualify if they have extremely low income and wealth, and they typically receive just $954.72 per month."}

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., put forward one that would prevent $1,400 stimulus checks from going to prisoners. The amendment failed on a party-line vote.\n\nCotton tweeted that this was another example of spending tucked in the bill that had nothing to do with pandemic.\n\n\"Senate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison,\" he tweeted March 6. \"They haven't lost their jobs, they aren't worried about paying rent or buying groceries.\"\n\nSenate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison.\n\nThey haven't lost their jobs, they aren't worried about paying rent or buying groceries.\n\nCotton repeated his point March 8 on Fox News, saying \"every single Democrat\" wanted to send checks to prisoners — invoking Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Charleston, S.C., church shooter Dylann Roof.\n\nThe record shows that Democrats rejected the amendment to prevent payments to prisoners.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said it would harm prisoners' families.\n\n\"Given the stark racial disparities in our criminal justice system, this would cause the most harm to Black and brown families and communities already harmed by mass incarceration,\" Durbin said on the Senate floor. \"Children should not be forced to go hungry because a parent is incarcerated.\"\n\nPrisoners qualify for stimulus payments because of broad eligibility requirements in this relief bill — and others. Prisoners must be a citizen or legal resident, and either need to have filed a tax return, possibly as part of a joint filing, or complete an Internal Revenue Service form requesting payment.\n\nIt's worth noting that the two previous rounds of stimulus checks during the Trump administration — in the CARES Act in March, and the supplemental package in December — allowed prisoners to receive checks, too.\n\nCotton voted for both of those bills.\n\nHis press secretary James Arnold said circumstances were different. In the CARES Act, the issue was \"an unanticipated problem,\" and in December, there was no opportunity to amend the bill.\n\nThe issue had come up before.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama's economic recovery package barred stimulus checks for most prisoners. Only a few thousand got them, through an exception in the law for those who had just gone to jail.\n\nIn 2020, Washington put a priority on getting checks to people as quickly as possible. The CARES Act kept the eligibility rules broad and simple. Basically, anyone who was an American citizen or permanent legal resident, wasn't claimed as a dependent by someone else, and had filed a tax return (or didn't need to because they made very little), could get a check.\n\nWith the December bill, Republicans could have added a prisoner ban to the legislation before it came to an up-or-down vote.\n\nThe issue of prisoners and stimulus checks had long been in the news. Earlier in the year, the IRS blocked CARES Act payments to prisoners. That prompted a class action lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people, arguing that the IRS rule was arbitrary and unlawful.\n\nIn October, a federal judge ruled against the IRS and said the government had to issue the checks. The judge ruled that the CARES Act had no language restricting payments to prisoners, and the administration couldn't invent one. That only applied to the CARES Act, but the point is, Republicans had ample opportunity to grapple with the issue as the December bill was being written."}

The American Rescue Plan also sent money directly to families in the form of the expanded federal . The first half of the newly expanded credit is being delivered directly to families.\n\nThere's a specific set of people that the IRS was trying to reach and it could mean a lot of money for those families.\n\nThe expanded Child Tax Credit payments can help out a family. The government sends families $300 for each child under the age of 6. Families get $250 per child ages 6 to 17. The payments are happening between July and December of 2021. That means a family with one child under 6 years old will have received $1,800 by the time the advanced payments end in December.\n\nThere are some families that were not already receiving the payments who also do not normally file a tax return because of the amount of money they make. People could have received these benefits, even if they don't work and even if they receive no income. There was a timeline for those families to sign up for the one-time payment. They needed to notify the IRS of their status by November 15.\n\nAccording to the IRS, those families will get the entire first half of the Child Tax Credit as a single payment. Families who signed up by Monday will receive half of their total Child Tax Credit on December 15. This means a payment of up to $1,800 for each child, under 6, and up to $1,500 for each child, ages 6 to 17.\n\nThe future of the expanded Child Tax Credit is up in the air. The Biden administration would like to and to make the expanded credit permanent.\n\nSome lawmakers in Washington D.C want to make changes to the tax credit - namely Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who, in particular, would like to to the payments."}

All the while, the movement for more direct relief in the form of fourth and/or fifth-round stimulus checks, or recurring payments has only grown.\n\nA restaurant owner named Stephanie Bonin started a petition early in the pandemic, campaigning for $2,000 monthly recurring payments.

That includes non-citizens.\n\nFor example, a citizen of Canada who is living and working full time in the U.S. would have a Social Security number and would be eligible for a stimulus payment.\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security website describes unauthorized immigrants as foreign-born non-citizens who live in the United States without legal residence.\n\nIndividuals who overstay their visas but pay tax in the United States using a Social Security number can be eligible for stimulus payments. The most recent available data for the number of visa overstays in the United States is from 2019, released by the Department of Homeland Security. It said that 1.21 percent of visas in that year were overstayed, or 676,422 overstays. In 2019, student visas (1.52 percent) had a higher overstay rate than those from Canada and Mexico (.75 percent, 1.27 percent, respectively).\n\nIllegal immigrants would not be eligible to receive a check if they do not have a Social Security number.\n\nImmigrants who overstay their visas no longer are lawfully in the country but retain their Social Security numbers and therefore are eligible to receive a check.\n\n\"Technically, if they have overstayed their visa, they are here illegally,\" a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Newsweek. \"If a visitor has not been granted an extension of status by USCIS [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services], then they are considered to be overstays and subject to deportable status under 237 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\"\n\nBut Durbin is not convinced that the number of overstays with Social Security cards is as high as Cruz said.\n\nA Durbin aide released a statement that said, in part:\n\n\"CBP's limited data sample of overstays and other estimates of visa overstay numbers do not contain the numbers of tax filers with SSNs who overstayed visas. It is simply false to assume that each visa overstayer has a social security number, for which the person must have been work-authorized to qualify for a SSN in the first place. By far the largest visa category of visas issued/visas overstayed each year (tourist/business B visas) according to DHS data do not qualify noncitizens to get a SSN.\n\n\"Generalized visa overstay estimates do not reveal how many individuals have overstayed visas who were a) authorized to work, b) provided the documentation necessary to get a Social Security Number, c) did not subsequently get a green card or otherwise obtain a lawful immigration status, d) overstayed their visa, but e) continued filing tax returns with the IRS such that they now qualify for stimulus checks.\n\n\"Additionally, a claim based on incomplete visa overstay data about the American Rescue Plan stimulus checks must also acknowledge that this hypothetical scenario (of stimulus checks going to visa overstayers with SSNs) would have applied just the same to the CARES Act and the December 2020 stimulus package, and is not a new or unique feature of the American Rescue Plan.\"\n\nPeople who qualify as legal residents include those who have passed the green card test (permanent legal residents) or those who pass the substantial presence test. That test requires taxpayers to be physically present in the United States for 31 days of the current year and 183 days for the past three years.\"\n\nAnyone who has a green card is considered a legal permanent resident, and would be eligible for the stimulus payment.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nTrue."}

But it's not clear whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders will roll a new stimulus check into upcoming legislation to fix U.S. infrastructure and help families.\n\nAnd, there's no guarantee a fourth round of direct aid would ever win approval. Republicans can be counted on to oppose it, and moderate Democrats probably wouldn't support the idea either. They questioned whether the recent third stimulus checks were necessary.\n\nBut if you're eager for another payment, to help you cover your bills and pay down debt, more federal money may already be pointed in your direction. At the very least, it's within reach.\n\nHere are a few ways you can get what might be considered a fourth stimulus check, without any new action from Congress.\n\nMonthly stimulus checks for families start up soon\n\n@natasha_lebedinskaya / Twenty20\n\nStarting July 15, the IRS will send out monthly payments to households, under a temporary expansion of the child tax credit that was included in the COVID stimulus bill President Joe Biden signed in March.\n\nFor six months, families will receive $250 for each child ages 6 to 17, and $300 for every kid younger than 6.\n\nThe checks will provide half the expanded credit for 2021. The rest can be taken as refunds when recipients file income taxes next year.\n\nThe full credit is worth $3,000 for 6- to 17-year-olds, and $3,600 for every child under 6. The usual maximum credit is $2,000 per kid, and only up to age 16.\n\nIf your family has filed your taxes this year, the IRS should have enough information to give you your child credit payments. If you don't normally file a return, the tax agency recently launched a non-filer sign-up tool you can use to make sure you get whatever child tax credit funds you qualify for.\n\nHomeowners can get stimulus checks\n\nThough the pandemic ushered in ultra-low mortgage rates that have showered many homeowners with refinance savings, others are still struggling to make their house payments.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you're having trouble staying current on your mortgage and worry you might be headed for delinquency or even foreclosure, the government has money to help.\n\nBiden's COVID rescue package from March created a $10 billion homeowner assistance fund. A minimum $50 million has been appropriated for each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n\nTo get your share of the mortgage relief, you'll have to provide evidence you're under financial stress due to COVID. You're eligible if you earn no more than 150% of your area's median income, and if your loan balance doesn't exceed $548,250.\n\nYou apply for the homeowners assistance through your state's housing agency.\n\nStimulus cash is available for renters, too\n\nIn the two most recent pandemic relief bills — the one from March and an earlier one signed in December — Congress approved a total of $46.6 billion in emergency aid for tenants who can't afford to pay rent.\n\nThe National Low Income Housing Coalition calls the amount of support available for renters \"unprecedented.\"\n\nYou can receive help if you're able to provide proof that you're struggling to pay rent or utilities because of the pandemic, and that you're facing a risk of homelessness.\n\nRenters who qualify can get up to 18 months of assistance to cover both missed and future rent. In one state, eligible renters can receive as much as $4,600 a month; in another, they can get lump sums of up to $25,000.\n\nThe funds are being distributed by more than 400 state and local agencies.\n\nWhat about a real fourth stimulus check?\n\nU.S. senators, members of the influential House Ways and Means Committee and millions of petition signers all have made the case that many Americans still require financial assistance due to ongoing disruptions from the pandemic."}

You know, it hurts to see one of your ... closest friends get in an accident. Man, I just hope he's all right. Just worry for his kids, you know. I'm sure they're struggling.\"\n\nJack Nicklaus, the 18-times major champion and lone name above Woods on the all-time leaderboard, said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the news in a statement. \"Barbara and I just heard about Tiger's accident, and like everyone else, we are deeply concerned,\" Nicklaus said. \"We want to offer him our heartfelt support and prayers at this difficult time.\"\n\nThe PGA Tour released a statement shortly after news of the crash broke, saying: \"On behalf of the PGA Tour and our players, Tiger is in our prayers and will have our full support as he recovers.\"\n\nWoods had been in California to film a TV programme for Discovery and Golf Digest, featuring the former NBA player Dwyane Wade and the actor David Spade. He also attended the PGA Tour's Genesis Invitational at Riviera over the weekend. He has not played competitive golf this year after undergoing back surgery last month.\n\nIn May 2017, Woods was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in Florida after he was discovered passed out in his car. He later pleaded guilty to reckless driving over the incident, and said his condition was caused by prescribed medications.\n\nWoods was also involved in another crash in 2009 near his home in Florida, which led to news that he had been unfaithful to his then wife, Elin Nordegren. The fallout led to Woods losing sponsors and he took an extended break from golf to address problems in his private life."}

Forensic experts weigh in.\n\nThe available evidence from the recent car crash involving Tiger Woods indicates that the famed golfer was not paying attention to the road and drifted off of it before crashing his car, three forensic car accident experts told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe same experts also say the evidence does not indicate he lost control of his vehicle because of excessive speed on a curved downhill road that is known for speeding cars.\n\nThey arrived at this theory based on several factors, especially the way Woods' vehicle appeared to keep going straight ahead instead of staying on the road as it curved right.\n\nWoods, 45, was traveling north near Los Angeles when his sports utility vehicle left its lane, went across the median into the southbound lanes, went off the road, hit a tree, rolled over and sustained major frontal damage. Woods also broke multiple bones in his lower right leg, which indicates he was applying the brake at the time of impact, according to the experts. They also said the evidence indicates Woods applied the brake late into the collision sequence.\n\n\"To me, this is like a classic case of falling asleep behind the wheel, because the road curves and his vehicle goes straight,\" said Jonathan Cherney, a consultant who provides car accident analysis as an expert witness in court cases. Cherney, a former police detective, examined the Woods' crash site in person since the accident on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a drift off the road, almost like he was either unconscious, suffering from a medical episode or fell asleep and didn't wake up until he was off the road and that's where the brake application came in,\" Cherney said.\n\nThere were no skid marks on the road to indicate braking, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva. Woods' vehicle did have anti-lock brakes. So even if he was to slam on the brakes prior to hitting the curb, \"you wouldn't necessarily see tire marks,\" said Felix Lee, an accident reconstruction expert who is part of the Expert Institute, a network that provides expert witnesses in litigation.\n\nLee said a key clue is how the vehicle did not change direction entering the curve and instead went directly into the median.\n\n\"My feeling is that speed wasn't that much of an issue,\" Lee said. \"It was just some kind of inattention that caused the curb strike.\"\n\nAfter leaving his lane and striking the median, Woods' vehicle went about 400 feet before stopping. Cherney said he didn't see evidence of \"any steering input\" that would indicate Woods tried to avoid the emergency.\n\nThis suggests a \"very delayed response\" by Woods to the situation, said Rami Hashish, principal at the National Biomechanics Institute, which analyzes the cause of accidents. \"It was suggesting he wasn't paying attention at all.\"\n\nHashish said he suspects the damage to the vehicle and Woods would have been much greater if he had been traveling at an excessive speed. The speed limit on that road is 45 mph.\n\n\"You can walk away with a broken leg from 45 to 50 mph,\" Hashish said. \"If you're hitting 60, 65 and you're hitting a stationary object, your likelihood of death increases exponentially.\"\n\nIf he was going 80 mph, \"he wouldn't be having an open fracture in this leg,\" Hashish said. \"He'd be dead.\""}

But that's where we are this week as Woods competes in the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie, at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando.\n\nWhat can we expect from Woods this week, and the rest of the year? It all depends on his body. That's been his truth for awhile, and will be his truth going forward — \"It's my reality and I've accepted it,\" Woods told Golf Digest recently. Woods suffered open fractures to both the tibia and fibula in his lower right leg. Less serious but concurrent damage occurred with Woods' ankle and soft tissue in his lower leg. And less than a year later, he's clearly able to peg it in a reasonable way right now.\n\nWhen Woods hosted 20 of the best players in the world at the Hero World Challenge earlier this month, he clued us in a bit to where his body is at, and what his rehab process has been like. Woods was largely bedridden for three months following the surgeries to his lower body, but he did walk with crutches about two months after the accident, by his estimate. He also admitted that he probably walked without crutches a bit earlier than his doctors advised him to.\n\nIn the months that followed the accident, Woods said, he was gracious just to go outside and feel the sun on his face. \"It's hard to explain how difficult it has been just to be immobile for the three months, just lay there and I was just looking forward to getting outside.\"\n\nWoods' recovery, in terms of golf, has meant chipping and putting in his backyard, and playing short-game competitions against Charlie. Positive as that may be, Woods noted that he is not able to grind through practice sessions like he used to, like during his comeback prior to this one.\n\n\"I don't foresee this leg ever being what it used to be, hence I'll never have the back what it used to be, and clock's ticking,\" Woods told reporters. \"I'm getting older, I'm not getting any younger. All that combined means that a full schedule and a full practice schedule and the recovery that it would take to do that, no, I don't have any desire to do that.\"\n\nDespite the uphill battle he still has ahead of him, Woods did practice repeatedly during the week in the Bahamas. He spent multiple days during the course of the tournament hitting full swing shots — even drivers — on the end of the driving range. So, how would he guess his future looks competing with his body on the PGA Tour? Woods has decided to invoke the story of Ben Hogan, who survived an auto accident to return and win at the highest level of the game."}

Scary enough that the odds of keeping his leg once stood \"damn-near 50/50,\" according to Tiger himself.\n\n\"There was a point in time when, I wouldn't say it was 50/50, but it was damn-near there if I was going to walk out of that hospital with one leg,\" Woods told Golf Digest in an interview released Monday.\n\nThe revelation comes on the heels of Woods' first public comments in nearly nine months: a 40-minute interview in which Woods discussed his injuries, his path back to professional golf, and his advice for his son Charlie.\n\nOn the topic of the accident in Rolling Hills Estates, Calif., Woods had plenty to say — though the news might come as a stark dose of reality for many hoping for a similar comeback to the one Woods completed in 2018. The 15-time major champion seemed resigned to the fact that his body no longer has what it takes to compete regularly at a high level.\n\n\"I don't have to compete and play against the best players in the world to have a great life,\" he said. \"After my back fusion, I had to climb Mount Everest one more time. I had to do it, and I did. This time around, I don't think I'll have the body to climb Mount Everest, and that's okay.\"\n\nInstead, Woods seemed to indicate his desire to follow in the footsteps of Ben Hogan, playing only a select number of tournaments at his own discretion. But that future is still a long way from the present.\n\n\"I think something that is realistic is playing the Tour one day — never full time, ever again — but pick and choose, just like [Ben] Hogan did,\" he said. \"Pick and choose a few events a year and you play around that, you practice around that, and you gear yourself up for that. I think that's how I'm going to have to play it from now on. It's an unfortunate reality, but it's my reality. I understand it, and I accept it.\"\n\nWoods spoke extensively about the rehab process, including a prolonged stay in isolation in southern California, during which time he received near round-the-clock treatment.\n\n\"In a hotel room and I'm hooked up with wires everywhere and people poking and prodding me at 2-3 in the morning for more bloodwork,\" he said. \"It was just like, c'mon. You know? How much is enough?\"\n\nOnce Woods recovered to the point that he was no longer at risk of amputation, his attention shifted to his hands — testing to see he'd kept his dexterity in the wake of the crash.\n\n\"I wanted to test and see that I still had my hands. So even in the hospital, I had Erica [Herman] and Rob [McNamara] throw me something,\" he said. \"Throw it over here, catch it over there. Then the nurse comes in. 'What? I wasn't doing anything?' Nurse leaves, 'Okay, let's go!' We were being kids, we were isolated, we were doing shenanigans. Just anything to pass the time.\"\n\nIn March, he returned home to Florida after nearly a month in the hospital. He was kept inside for months, leaning on lessons from his father Earl to endure grueling rehab sessions.\n\n\"This is where my dad's teachings came into play,\" he said. \"Being in the military, you don't know how long a firefight's going to take. It could last five seconds, it could last five hours. Some could go on for days at a time. You don't know when the end is. That's the hard part.\""}

He struck a curb, mowed down a wooden sign and drove into opposing lanes before hitting a tree and rolling over in Rolling Hills Estates south of downtown Los Angeles. He suffered broken bones in his right leg that could jeopardize his golf career.\n\nAfter hitting the median, he traveled a distance of several hundred feet with no evidence of braking. Woods instead suddenly applied the gas pedal at 99% in the final seconds before hitting the raised median that separates the north and south lanes of the road, according the report. Woods also told investigators he does not remember driving.\n\nJonathan Cherney, a former police detective in Southern California, reviewed the crash scene Feb. 24 and said it was \"like a classic case of falling asleep behind the wheel, because the road curves and his vehicle goes straight.\"\n\nThe collision report boosts that notion, said Cherney, who was not involved in the sheriff's investigation but now works as a forensic crash reconstruction expert."}

Woods won't be a full-time golfer again, which was true of Hogan after his accident.\n\nHogan's car was hit head-on by a bus on a foggy Texas road on Feb. 2, 1949. Hogan had played four tournaments that year, including wins in the Bing Crosby Pro-Am and the Long Beach Open and a second in the Phoenix Open.\n\nHogan's body was badly broken in the accident, including two breaks in his pelvis, a broken leg, broken ribs, a broken collarbone and more. He also fought blood clots that nearly killed him three months after the accident.\n\nHogan miraculously returned to competitive golf in 1950, playing nine tournaments and winning three times, including the U.S. Open. But those nine tournaments would be the most he ever played in a single year again. The 1950 U.S. Open was one of six majors Hogan won after his accident. Three of those majors came in 1953, when he won the Masters, the U.S. Open and the British Open among his eight starts.\n\nLimited play because of injuries\n\nBut Hogan played just four tournaments in 1954 and another four in 1955. His badly damaged legs wouldn't allow him much more at the time.\n\nWoods has hardly been a full-time player in recent years, with back surgeries cutting down his play to just nine tournaments in the 2020 calendar year, including one unofficial start in the made-for-television The Match. He hasn't played any tournaments since the 2020 Masters played in November.\n\nWoods saying he will never be a top-level player again was hardly news, because he wasn't one of the top players in the game when he had his accident. In fact for the week of Feb. 28 this year, Woods was just 53rd in the Official World Golf Rankings. The accident and the damage to his already ailing body certainly had fans understanding that Woods was never going to be peak Tiger Woods again."}

The golf superstar had to be extricated, and his agent said he was undergoing leg surgery.\n\nWoods was alone in the SUV when it crashed shortly before 7:15 a.m., the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. No other cars were involved.\n\nThe cause of the wreck wasn't clear. The two-lane road curves through upscale suburbs and the northbound side that Woods was driving on descends steeply enough that signs warn trucks to use lower gears. The speed limit is 45 mph.\n\nA KABC-TV helicopter showed the car on its side, with its front end heavily damaged just off the side of a road near a hillside, with its airbags deployed. The 45-year-old Woods was taken to the hospital by ambulance, authorities said.\n\n\"Tiger Woods was in a single-car accident this morning in California where he suffered multiple leg injuries,\" said his manager, Mark Steinberg. \"He is currently in surgery and we thank you for your privacy and support.\"\n\nThe crash happened on the border of Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes, two upscale communities about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThere was a second crash when a vehicle that had apparently stopped to help Woods got hit, said Christopher Thomas, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. That wreck was very minor, and no one was hurt.\n\nWoods was in Los Angeles over the weekend as the tournament host of the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club, where he presented the trophy on Sunday. He was to spend Monday and Tuesday filming with Discovery-owned GOLFTV, with whom he has an endorsement. A tweet Monday showed Woods in a cart smiling with comedian David Spade.\n\nAccording to Golf Digest, also owned by Discovery, the TV shoot was on-course lessons for celebrities, such as Spade and Dwyane Wade, at Rolling Hills Country Club.\n\nWoods, a 15-time major champion who shares with Sam Snead the PGA Tour record of 82 career victories, has been recovering from Dec. 23 surgery on his lower back. It was his fifth back surgery and first since his lower spine was fused in April 2017, allowing him to stage a remarkable comeback that culminated with his fifth Masters title in 2019.\n\nHe has carried the sport since his record-setting Masters victory in 1997 when he was 21, winning at the most prolific rate in modern PGA Tour history. He is singularly responsible for TV ratings spiking, which has led to enormous increases in prize money during his career. Even at 45, he remains the biggest draw in the sport.\n\nThe SUV he was driving Tuesday had tournament logos on the side door, indicating it was a courtesy car for players at the Genesis Invitational. Tournament director Mike Antolini did not immediately respond to a text message, though it is not unusual for players to keep courtesy cars a few days after the event.\n\nWoods feared he would never play again until the 2017 fusion surgery. He returned to win the Tour Championship to close out the 2018 season and won the Masters in April 2019 for the fifth time.\n\nHe last played Dec. 20 in the PNC Championship in Orlando, Florida, an unofficial event where players are paired with parents or children. He played with his son, Charlie, who is now 12. Woods also has a 13-year-old daughter."}

Elin Nordegren, his wife at the time, used two golf clubs to break the rear windows of the vehicle. Though Nordegren told police that she had broken the windows to help rescue an incoherent Woods from the vehicle, there was widespread speculation that she had shattered the glass following an argument.\n\nFor more on Tiger Woods, listen below to the episode of PEOPLE Every Day.\n\nThat accident was the beginning of a public spiral for Woods, whose life and career are explored in HBO's new two-part documentary Tiger. Dozens of women soon came forward, alleging that they had sexual relationships with the married golfer.\n\nWithin months, Woods had lost most of his sponsors, and his golf game began to suffer — both due to his physical ailments and a loss of focus on the course. In August of 2010, Nordegren filed for divorce, and received a reported $100 million settlement.\n\nFor more on Woods and the latest developments in his life and career, pick up this week's issue of PEOPLE, on stands Friday.\n\nEven now, the scandal is a painful memory for Woods.\n\n\"He hates anything to do with the scandal,\" a source close to the golfer tells PEOPLE in this week's issue. \"It brings back such painful memories of a really embarrassing, awful, harrowing time in his life. There are no good times he can remember from 2009 and 2010. None. He lost it all, publicly, and had to rebuild.\"\n\nBy all accounts, Woods, 45, has worked very hard to fix his life — and has been successful.\n\nFor one thing, Woods' repaired his career, and won the 2019 Masters Tournament.\n\nStill, there have been setbacks. This week, Woods' team announced that the golfer had undergone yet another back surgery, this time \"a microdiscectomy procedure to remove a pressurized disc fragment that was pinching his nerve after experiencing discomfort following the PNC Championship.\"\n\nA message shared on Woods' Twitter said doctors believe the operation was a success and \"expect him to make a full recovery.\"\n\nNo matter what life throws at Woods, his friends say that he's overcome worse odds in the past.\n\n\"He rebuilt his entire life,\" the source says. \"He became a better person and a much better dad than he was before. It put him on the right track. He's more compassionate and forgiving. He treats people like his equals now. And he is such a good dad.\"\n\nAccording to the source, Woods' two kids — son Charlie, 11, and daughter Sam, 13 — are very close to both parents.\n\n\"They're fantastic with the kids,\" says the source. \"They communicate. The kids still see them as a parenting team, even though they're not together anymore. It's remarkable.\""}

Woods also told deputies twice that he didn't remember how the crash occurred and didn't even remember driving after surviving the crash with broken bones in his right leg.\n\nSuch clues, including the lack of braking evidence on the road, have led experts to question two particular sheriff-department decisions as the investigation remains ongoing:\n\n- To frame the crash as an \"accident\" right away. Hours after the crash, the sheriff and the deputy who responded to the 911 call both emphasized the downhill road as a potential cause.\n\n- To not bring in a drug-recognition expert (DRE), a law enforcement officer who is trained to identify clues of impairment and determine whether the driver should have his blood examined for medications or other drugs. Calling on a DRE can be routine in serious crash investigations, but it is up to each agency in charge.\n\n\"LASD is not releasing any further information at this time,\" the sheriff's department said in a statement Friday. \"The traffic collision investigation is ongoing and traffic investigators continue to work to determine the cause of the collision.\"\n\nWoods' agent, Mark Steinberg, didn't return a message seeking comment.\n\nAccident reconstruction experts said Woods' inability to remember driving at all was reason enough to bring in a DRE, if only to be thorough in the investigation.\n\n\"Exactly, exactly,\" said Charles Schack, a former New Hampshire state police trooper who is now president of Crash Experts, which analyzes traffic accidents for law firms and insurance companies. \"I would have thought that you would have him evaluated by a DRE to see whether or not there are some physical clues beyond the operation that would point to impairment. To an untrained person, sometimes the effects are a bit more subtle, and require a bit more in-depth examination to bring out the evidence of impairment.\"\n\nDREs don't automatically call for blood to be examined. They instead make a determination of whether it's necessary at the end of a 12-step process. That protocol can take place away from the crash scene, and it includes questioning the driver about medications and examining the driver's eyes and vital signs.\n\nA day after the crash, Villanueva gave the following reason for not bringing a DRE into the Woods case a day earlier:\n\n\"The deputy at the scene assessed the condition of Tiger Woods and there was no evidence of any impairment whatsoever,\" Villanueva said. \"He was lucid, no odor of alcohol, no evidence of any medication, narcotics or anything like that would bring that into question. So that was not a concern at the time. So therefore, obviously no field sobriety test and no DRE.\""}

Driver was treated for his injuries at the hospital and was asked there again how the collision occurred. He repeated that he did not know and did not remember driving.\"\n\nSchloegl said he believed information stored on the black box — such as the speed the car was traveling at the time of the crash — would assist in determining how and why the collision occurred, according to the affidavit.\n\nData from the car Woods was driving \"constitutes evidence that tends to show the commission of a felony or misdemeanor offense,'' according to the form filled out to obtain the search warrant. But Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva has said the ongoing investigation into the crash is not a criminal investigation.\n\n\"The investigators in the accident, or in the collision, they did a search warrant to seize in essence the black box of the vehicle,'' Villanueva said Wednesday. \"And that's all it is. And they're going to go through it and see if they can find out what was the performance of the vehicle, what was happening at the time of impact. And with that, they'll have more information they can attribute the cause of the accident. And that's all it is, and we'll leave it at that, OK?''\n\nVillanueva also addressed why the sheriff's department did not seek a warrant to obtain a sample of Woods' blood that could be used to determine whether someone was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n\n\"In order to seek a search warrant, you have to have evidence of impairment,'' said Villanueva, who had previously stated there was no evidence that Woods was impaired at the time of the collision. \"Absent the evidence of impairment ... you're not going to get a search warrant.

After the round he told reporters about his Masters Week, which included a visit to Woods' home, just minutes away from Fowler's on Jupiter Island.\n\nThe visit marked the first time Fowler had seen Woods since Woods' February car crash, which left him in a hospital bed for weeks before he was able to return home.\n\n\"Between that and the British Open, those are two tournaments that I love to watch,\" Fowler said of the Masters. \"Typically I'm in them and I'm watching either the morning or afternoon wave when I'm not playing, so it was a little difference in that sense, being at home.\"\n\nFowler acknowledged that both he and Woods were disappointed not to be playing the event, but he still got plenty out of the experience. Woods, after all, has won five times at Augusta National, most recently in 2019. Fowler has five top-12 finishes in 10 Masters starts, including a runner-up in 2018.\n\n\"It was fun to be able to do that, talk about the course.

We were both definitely disappointed that we couldn't be out there to experience it because it's very few times where you do get to see Augusta that firm and fast.\"\n\nFowler wasn't the first Tour pro to visit Woods at home. Justin Thomas had gone by several times, and Rory McIlroy had stopped in to see him, too.

It was just a couple months ago that players were wearing red and black on Sunday at the WGC-Concession to let Woods know they were thinking of him as he recovered post-surgery. Subsequent reports have only made it that much more clear that Woods was fortunate to escape the crash.\n\n\"Getting to be around him on a bit more of a personal level and getting to know him, especially over the last really five, six years, you know, we try and push him as hard as we can, but at the same time it's still pretty cool to get to go hang out and spend time with Tiger,\" Fowler said."}

But none hit harder than the news out of Southern California, on the morning of Feb. 23 this year.\n\nThis was not back surgery, or tabloid scandal, or a comeback run to another major. This was a more elemental moment: a once-in-a-lifetime golfer in a brush with death.\n\nUnlike his prior headline-making mishaps at the wheel — one a run-in with a hydrant, the other a mugshot-yielding DUI — the terrifying crash, on a curvy road near Rancho Palo Verdes, brought no mockery from pundits, no media scorn.

Why no charges? Had law enforcement granted Tiger special treatment? — the sheriff's accident report left much unanswered. But as Woods returned to Florida to recoup in private, there was largely willingness to let matters lie. Life, and golf, went on.\n\nFour majors. A Ryder Cup. A Brooks and Bryson sideshow.

Would he, could he, compete on Tour again? Might he make a go at another Masters? It was understandable, all the future tripping. Woods, as ever, was stirring up excitement.\n\nBut really, what he'd given us was cause for reflection.\n\nA cop responding to the accident had been the first to say, and Tiger himself would repeat it later: he was lucky to be alive."}

(Feb. 24) AP\n\n\"The protocols they have in place now to win this award are incredibly challenging,\" Latouf said. \"You don't just by chance win the award. It requires intensive engineering planning at the early stages.\"\n\nWhile new vehicles are substantially safer than vehicles from decades earlier, they are not impervious to deadly accidents. More than 36,000 people were killed in car crashes on American roadways in 2019, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nOn social media, some people speculated that the SUV's safety features may have saved the golf legend's life.\n\nThe Genesis GV80's safety systems include:\n\n• 10 standard airbags, including one that deploys in the center of the vehicle as well as a driver-side knee airbag.\n\n\"The vehicle is loaded up with airbags,\" Latouf said.\n\n• Advanced driver assistance systems, including forward-collision alert avoidance, stability control, evasive steering technology and an interior camera that alerts the driver if they're falling asleep.\n\n• New vehicle architecture, known in the industry as a \"platform,\" built with a passenger compartment reinforced with high strength steel to provide rigidity in case of a crash.\n\n\"Safety is foundational to the brand at Genesis, and it's really important that we deliver on that promise,\" Latouf said.\n\nThe 2021 Genesis GV80, which carries a starting price of nearly $50,000, also has a 14.5-inch horizontal touchscreen on the center console and an 8-inch digital instrument panel."}

He was 43. But he knew his golf history as well as he knew the famed layout at Augusta National, where he had won four times, and set the record straight.\n\n\"One of the greatest comebacks in all of sports is the gentleman who won here, Mr. Hogan,\" Woods said of Ben Hogan, a two-time Masters winner who is universally revered and always referred to as \"Mr. Hogan.\" Never \"Ben.\"\n\nWoods continued, \"I mean, he got hit by a bus and came back and won major championships. The pain he had to endure, the things he had to do just to play, the wrapping of the leg, all the hot tubs, and just how hard it was for him to walk, period ... One of the greatest comebacks there is and it happens to be in our sport.\"\n\nWoods won the tournament.\n\nBen Hogan has been dead for nearly a quarter-century, but his name has been trending this week in the wake of Woods' horrible car accident in California. Woods wasn't even out of surgery before speculation arose about another Tiger comeback, this time maybe even bigger than Hogan's. Woods is being held to a very high standard — that of the man who returned from a near-death experience to win seven majors in the next four years.\n\nThe two are inextricably linked both by history and success. Hogan was the dominant player of his era, which spanned from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s. Likewise, Woods ruled the golf world for more than a decade. Woods won more majors, but Hogan only competed in the British Open once (he won) and stopped participating in the PGA after winning it for a second time in 1948. Both men are on any serious fan's Golf Mt. Rushmore."}

The speed, and Wood's failure to handle a curve, led to the crash, the sheriff said.\n\nThe powerful collision, at a bend on Hawthorne Boulevard near Blackhorse Road on the Palos Verdes Peninsula at around 7:15 a.m. Feb. 23, launched the the car into the air.\n\nThe SUV went spinning until coming to a rest several hundred feet away, sheriff's Capt. James Powers said.\n\n\"The impact of the vehicle when it hit the tree caused the vehicle to go airborne, and do a somewhat pirouette, landing on its side,\" Powers said.\n\nThe data recorder indicates Woods never hit his brakes as he drifted toward the median, but detectives believe he \"inadvertently hit the accelerator\" as he tried to brake, the sheriff's captain said. Woods was cooperative with investigators but told them he doesn't recall the collision, sheriff's officials said.\n\nA seat-belted Woods was trapped inside until firefighters and paramedics pulled him out through the windshield.\n\nHawthorne Boulevard's downward stretch is known for bad accidents. Neighbors have described the sloping, curvy stretch of roadway as notorious for crashes, especially among those not from the area. It is not uncommon for drivers to travel in excess of 80 mph there.\n\nWoods was the only person in the vehicle. Villanueva said he was not cited for an infraction, nor was he charged with a crime.\n\nThe sheriff repeated on Wednesday that there was no sign the 45-year-old Woods was impaired. After he was rescued from the vehicle, Woods had help sitting up from deputies. Despite suffering significant injuries, he was alert, Powers said.\n\nWoods has famously been involved in at least two other incidents on the road involving apparent impairment, both times in Florida: In 2009 he was found unconscious in his car after a crash and later admitted to taking Ambien; eight years later he was arrested and pleaded guilty to reckless driving after a toxicology report found multiple prescription drugs in his system.\n\nIn the Rolling Hills Estates crash, no law enforcement officer witnessed what happened, so Woods could not be cited for speeding, the sheriff said. And without probable cause that Woods was impaired or distracted, the sheriff said, investigators could not seek a blood-alcohol test or try to obtain a search warrant for calls made or received on his cell phone.\n\n\"Past history does not get you the elements you need for probable cause,\" said Villaneuva, adding Woods was treated the same as anyone else would have been. \"I'll leave it at that.\""}

So that was not a concern at the time. So therefore, obviously no field sobriety test and no DRE,\" the sheriff added.\n\nBut former detective Jonathan Cherney, who walked the scene after the crash, also said the evidence suggests it was \"like a classic case of falling asleep behind the wheel\" because \"the road curves and his vehicle goes straight.\"\n\nIf Woods had been looking at his phone momentarily, investigators would expect to see evidence that he braked or tried to steer out of the median long before the wreck.\n\n\"Impaired people have a tendency of crashing, so if you have a situation like this one, where you have a single-vehicle crash, with out-of-the-ordinary-type circumstances, that should trigger the first responder to inquire further and to explore impairment as a possible cause of the collision,\" Cherney told the outlet.\n\nThe accident reconstructionist agreed that the fact that Woods twice told deputies he couldn't remember driving at all \"absolutely\" is a clue suggesting impairment.\n\n\"I do know significant head injuries can cause people to not know what happened or forget what happened,\" Cherney said. \"The fact that he doesn't remember driving at all is also indicative and consistent with the objective symptom of impaired driving.\"\n\nHowever, it is now too late to get access to Woods' blood and medical reports at the hospital without his cooperation or a search warrant, according to the report.\n\nTo get a warrant, police would need to convince a judge it is necessary and show probable cause that a crime had been committed — which would be \"difficult,\" Chris Taylor, managing attorney at Taylor & Taylor, a DUI defense specialist in Southern California, told USA Today Sport.\n\nThe sheriff's department eventually executed a search warrant to obtain the \"black box\" data from the SUV that could show how fast Woods was traveling, plus any braking or steering activity prior to impact.\n\nThe department has not released any of the findings.\n\nDuring emergency surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Woods had a rod inserted into his tibia and pins and screws in his foot and ankle. Three days later, he was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and underwent follow-up procedures."}

Let's get to that,\" Wade, 39, said. \"Certain people will say, 'The GOAT! The Greatest of All Time!'

Golf Digest\n\nWoods' sentiment about not being professionally done with golf came ahead of his career-threatening crash. On Feb. 23, he struck a sign in the road's center divider and cut through a tree.\n\nThe vehicle sustained major damage, and Woods underwent emergency surgery for \"significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity.\" It was the golfer's 11th major surgery. He did not return back home to Florida until mid-March.\n\nWade previously spoke about filming with Woods during an appearance on Inside the NBA on the day of the accident, saying \"we're all shaken\" by the news of the horrible crash.\n\n\"My prayers go out to him, and hopefully a speedy recovery for him, and hopefully he gets a chance to get back to doing what he loves to do, and that's playing the game of golf,\" he said.\n\nIn late May, Woods told Golf Digest that recovering from the crash has been \"an entirely different animal\" from his previous injuries.\n\n\"I understand more of the rehab processes because of my past injuries, but this was more painful than anything I have ever experienced,\" he shared. When asked by the outlet if he would be able to play golf again, the athlete declined to answer.\n\nUltimately, the Los Angeles County Sheriff found that speed was the primary cause of Woods' single-car rollover crash, but that there were \"no signs of impairment\" and that the pro golfer would not be cited for the accident.\n\nA Round with Tiger: Celebrity Playing Lessons airs Tuesdays on Golf Digest through August 10."}

As such, his right leg bore the brunt of the force to his body in the accident.\n\nWoods' overall injury pattern resembles what is common in high-speed motor vehicle injuries.\n\nAccording to Dr. Provencher, though not fully confirmed, Woods' injuries include:\n\nOpen tibia and fibula fractures, compound and comminuted in nature. Compound means the bones were through the skin, and comminuted means they were not \"clean\" breaks, and the bones had numerous fragments.\n\nInjuries to his ankle and foot area. Though this is still unclear, Woods might have had an ankle fracture, an injury to the bone that supports the ankle (the talus) or an injury to the midfoot, called a Lisfranc injury. Any of these could affect ankle mobility and function.\n\nDamage to the soft tissues surrounding the tibia. The fractures Woods sustained cause injuries to the skin and muscles of the calf. Also, blood from the injured bones and muscles can cause the calf compartment to swell.\n\nWoods fractured both the tibia and fibula in his right leg, and it has been reported that the tibia was open (bone through the skin) and comminuted (broken in multiple pieces). This is the typical location for a break in the tibia and fibula in this kind of fracture. A surgical rod was used to stabilize Woods' leg.\n\nWoods had a titanium nail placed in his tibia, a common treatment for this kind of fracture. Nails are typically permanent and biocompatible (hence, made of titanium), and they stabilize the bone. The nail restores the tibia to its natural length and controls rotation, ensuring the tibia is aligned with the ankle and foot bones.\n\nWoods had his calf compartment released during surgery. That was likely due to swelling in the calf, which can suffocate the muscle from blood flow and cause necrosis (death) of the muscle tissue — which is dangerous and irreversible — or as a preventive measure to avoid compartment syndrome, which is important for successful recovery.\n\nWhat are some other concerns?"}

He seemed as though he was lucid,\" Gonzalez said.\n\n\"He didn't seem concerned about his injuries at the time, which is not uncommon in traffic collisions.

While there was no evidence that Woods, who received a ticket for reckless driving after a minor accident in 2009 and pled guilty to driving under the influence in 2017, was inebriated, County Sheriff Alex Villanueva reported that it appeared that the star was speeding at the time of the crash.\n\nAt approximately 7 am in the morning, Woods' SUV collided with a raised median, crossed two oncoming lanes of traffic, and struck a tree. The vehicle is thought to have rolled over several times before coming to rest on its side. This is known as a 'rollover' accident, which is more likely to result in fatal injuries than other types of crashes. The golf mogul's injuries, while not fatal, were serious: they included open tibia and fibula fractures, which were compound (meaning that the bones broke through the skin) and comminuted (meaning that the bones were in fragments). After undergoing emergency surgery, which involved the insertion of rods, pins and screws into his legs, Woods is now in recovery.\n\nWhile clearly fortunate to have escaped death, the ramifications of such serious injuries are of great concern, both for Woods himself and the golfing world at large. Widely regarded as the greatest golf player of his generation, his dazzling array of accolades include eighty-two PGA tour wins, five Masters Tournament victories (the latest of which was in 2019), and six-hundred and eighty-three weeks ranked world number one. Woods, age forty-five, placed his professional career on indefinite hold after a fifth spinal surgery in December 2020, and sports commentators fear that the debilitating injuries from his car crash may catalyse his retirement.\n\nIn a statement released on Twitter, however, Woods thanked the medical professionals who took care of him at the Harbour-UCLA Medical Centre and Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre, and assured fans that he is 'recovering at home' and 'working on getting stronger every day'. As of yet, he has given no indication that he is considering retirement. One of the more optimistic commentators, former PGA Tour player Bill Mallon expressed hope for the star's return to professional tournaments in an interview with BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter. Emphasising that Woods received immediate treatment and did not suffer from infection, Mallon estimated that his fractures could heal in as little as six weeks, and posited that the star would return to professional golf in a year."}

The extent of the coverage reflected Woods' status as one of the greatest golfers — and athletes — of all time.\n\n\"This is a tough guy, a very strong guy...He knows what it takes to endure a significant amount of pain,\" sportscaster Jim Gray said on Fox News which, like other networks, provided updates on his condition along with overhead helicopter shots of the neighborhood where the crash occurred, Rancho Palos Verdes, along with shots of the accident scene.\n\nSuch breaking news moments often are a bit of an exercise in filling time with relatively scant information about what happened.\n\nOn MSNBC, Cindy Boren of The Washington Post talked of Woods' recent trouble with his back and his recent surgery. She was asked if Woods was determined to continue playing out of a desire to break Jack Nicklaus' record for Masters wins. \"More important to him right now is his kids,\" she said.\n\nOn CNN, Kyung Lah read a statement from the PGA, which mentioned that Woods was in surgery, but cautioned that she didn't know when the statement was written.\n\n\"These pictures are obviously very alarming,\" she said, referring to images of the mangled car from which Woods reportedly was removed via the jaws of life. The Los Angeles County Fire Department later clarified that other tools were used to pry Woods free from the vehicle.\n\n\"It is gut wrenching. We obviously sit here and wish him well. We are thinking about his family and his two children,\" said anchor Brooke Baldwin.\n\nLater, she brought in CNN sports anchor Don Riddell, who talked of Woods' comeback in the 2019 Masters. He shared a story of talking with Woods a couple of years ago, and Woods mentioning that he thought the \"greatest comeback of all time\" was golfer Ben Hogan, who was in a serious car accident in the 1940s. \"We talk about narrative arcs and storylines, and now we have Tiger Woods potentially in a very, very similar situation,\" Riddell said."}

He doesn't shy from any question nor does he hide from any answer given.\n\nHe's an emotional sort, too, so it wasn't surprising McIlroy became a tad irritated during his conference call with reporters Wednesday ahead of the World Golf Championships-Workday Championship at The Concession Golf Club when a couple questions irked him.\n\n\"He's not Superman,\" McIlroy said when asked if Woods was the guy who can come back from his horrific car crash that left him with multiple, serious injuries to his right leg, ankle and foot.\n\n\"He's a human being at the end of the day,\" McIlroy continued. \"And he's already been through so much. At this stage I think everyone should just be grateful that he's here, that he's alive, that his kids haven't lost their dad.\n\n\"That's the most important thing. Golf is so far from the equation right now, it's not even on the map at this point.\"\n\nWoods, 45, was involved in a single-car rollover crash early Tuesday morning in the Los Angeles area. He was awake and responsive after surgeons at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center operated on his right leg; he shattered the tibia and fibula and suffered significant injuries to his right foot and ankle. A rod was inserted to stabilize his tibia and a combination of screws and pins were used to stabilize the ankle and foot.\n\nMcIlroy, 31, also was miffed about a query wondering if there was any talk about paying tribute to Woods during the tournament.\n\nGallery Photos: Tiger Woods through the years View 32 photos\n\n\"Like you say 'pay tribute to him.' He's not gone,\" McIlroy said. \"He's been in a very bad accident. We're very lucky that he's still here. I feel like we should pay tribute to him every day for being on the PGA Tour and what he's done for golf.\n\n\"It's always great when he plays at a tournament or is out here because it gives that tournament an extra dimension that it usually doesn't have. We're all sort of heading towards that day that Tiger wasn't going to be a part of the game. I'm not saying that that was soon. Before this accident, he was rehabbing a back injury and hopefully going to come back and play this year. It's inevitable that one day he won't be a part of it, and that's going to be just something that the game of golf and the Tour is going to have to deal with and adapt to.\n\n\"Obviously, hopefully, he comes back and is able to play, but if he's not, I think he'll still be a part of the game in some way, whether it's obviously his design business and his foundation and hosting golf tournaments. It may be the end of seeing the genius at work with a club in his hand, but there's still a lot of other ways that he can affect the game in a great way.\"\n\nAs for his own game, McIlroy, the former world No. 1 and four-time major champion, hasn't won since the fall of 2019 and is coming off a missed cut in last week's Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club north of Los Angeles. But in his next start after missing his last five cuts, McIlroy has two wins, a second, a fourth and a tie for 12th.\n\n\"It's funny, it's going to sound really weird, I worked so hard the week before Riviera in that week off, but I felt so unprepared to play, if that makes sense,\" he said. \"I stood on the range for hours a day hitting golf balls and working on my swing but didn't play golf. Didn't chip, didn't putt, didn't do any of the things that you need to do to shoot scores.\n\n\"So even though I worked hard and worked on some stuff, I feel like it's sort of like clockwork. I have these weeks where I want to work on some things and fix some things and I try to cram everything in in the space of a week when it's probably something that should take two or three months to iron out.\n\n\"I went to Riviera after feeling like I worked hard but was completely unprepared because I had sort of neglected sort of all other aspects of the game. I think I learned a couple of things last week. I was thinking way too much about the golf swing last week, even when I was out on the course."}

Northeastern's doctor was speaking in general terms about the nature of the golfer's state of mind and his outlook, post-surgery.\n\nCorrado describes Woods's injuries as \"debilitating\" and \"serious\" and warns it will be a long recovery ahead. No one can know for sure at this point how he will bounce back, and Woods may not ever return to championship golf form. Beyond his physical condition, another concern is the mental and emotional toll he will experience from being away from the sport that he revolutionized, Corrado says.\n\n\"For someone like Tiger, or even for our athletes, they have defined themselves by their sport for the entirety of their lives,\" he says. \"Some are very graceful about that, and some are not.\"\n\nCorrado says a danger for Woods is the temptation to abuse drugs and alcohol again. Woods pleaded guilty in 2017 to reckless driving and agreed to enter a diversion program that would wipe his record clean.\n\nHe had Vicodin, Dilaudid, Xanax, Ambien, and THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) in his system when he was arrested at that time on suspicion of driving under the influence, according to a toxicology report obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"The most important thing for him mentally is he doesn't spiral back down into substance abuse,\" says Corrado.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities on the scene of this week's crash said they checked for any odor of alcohol or other signs Woods was under the influence of a substance and found none, according to media reports.\n\n\"This is purely an accident,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva was quoted as saying.\n\nPost-surgery, Woods's focus should be on emotional healing, advises Dan Boothby, who oversees Northeastern's staff of athletic trainers, physical therapists, and strength-and-conditioning coaches.\n\nStaying positive after weeks of inactivity will be challenging for Woods, as it would be for any other elite athlete. \"The emotional piece is such an important part of it because that promotes physical healing,\" he says.\n\nTalk of a return to the links and the high level of play for which Woods was known is superseded by more pressing issues, Boothby adds. \"The fact that he's alive, the fact that there wasn't more significant injury, that's got to be the focus,\" he says.\n\nOnce Woods's bones and soft tissue are healed, rehabilitation will likely entail gentle range-of-motion exercises to stimulate neuromuscular activity before slowly ramping up the intensity, says Boothby. That will give Woods a better idea of what his physical limitations are. Setbacks, he warns, are to be expected."}

Of course, Brady did what Brady does and helped the Tampa Bay Buccaneers win the Vince Lombardi for the second time in franchise history.\n\nThe win on the game's biggest stage was Brady's seventh, allowing him to add to his already legendary collection of Super Bowl records. In fact, let's take a closer look at them.\n\nMost Super Bowl wins: 7\n\nBrady is just lapping the field when it comes to Super Bowl wins. Seven rings — the first six of which earned as a member of the New England Patriots — is two more than the next closest player. Defensive lineman Charles Haley won five rings with the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys. Among quarterbacks, Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw are next with four wins on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nMost Super Bowl appearances: 10\n\nSunday's Super Bowl was the 10th time Brady had led his team to the title game. He has now done so on more than half of his non-injured seasons as a starting quarterback, and thus appeared in 18 percent of all Super Bowls played so far. The player coming closest to him is former Buffalo Bills and Denver Broncos defensive lineman Mike Lodish, who appeared in six Super Bowls. Among quarterbacks, John Elway's five appearances come closest.\n\nMost Super Bowl MVP awards: 5\n\nJoe Montana was named the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player in three of his title game appearances, but Brady has long passed his former idol on that list. He now has earned the MVP five times: he earned it after Super Bowls 36, 38, 49 and 51 in New England, and now after the 55th edition of the big game in Tampa Bay. The only teammates of his who were able to earn the trophy were wide receivers Deion Branch (Super Bowl 39) and Julian Edelman (Super Bowl 53).\n\nMost Super Bowl pass attempts: 421\n\nBrady dropped back to pass 30 times on Sunday, with 29 passes leaving his right arm. He therefore became the first quarterback to cross the 400-attempt mark in the Super Bowl to bring his total to 421. Next on that list is Peyton Manning, who threw 155 passes during his four games with the Broncos and Indianapolis Colts.\n\nMost Super Bowl completions: 277\n\nDue to his 21 completions against Kansas City, Brady now has thrown more successful passes in the Super Bowl than the next three quarterbacks on the list combined: Peyton Manning (103), Kurt Warner (83) and Joe Montana (83) have thrown 269 completions during their careers. The three Hall of Famers have played in 11 games together, showing that Brady's completions are not just a pure volume statistic.\n\nMost Super Bowl touchdown passes: 21\n\nBrady threw three touchdowns against the Chiefs defense, hooking up twice with Rob Gronkowski and once with Antonio Brown. He therefore now has 10 more scoring throws in the Super Bowl than the next closest competitor: Joe Montana threw 11 touchdown passes in his four title game appearances with the San Francisco 49ers. Fun fact, Brady is only tied for fourth when it comes to interceptions thrown (6).\n\nMost Super Bowl passing yards: 3,039\n\nBrady added 201 passing yards against the Chiefs on Sunday to cross the 3,000-yard barrier and further set himself apart from the next closest player in this category. Kurt Warner, who played in three Super Bowls with the then-St. Louis Rams and Arizona Cardinals, passed for a combined 1,156 yards.\n\nMost pass attempts in a single Super Bowl: 62\n\nThe Patriots took the Atlanta Falcons to overtime in Super Bowl 51, which allowed Brady to attempt the most passes ever thrown in a single title game. When all was said and done, he had thrown the ball 62 times for 466 yards that day. Only Jim Kelly's performance in Super Bowl 26 — the Buffalo Bills legend attempted 58 throws — comes close to Brady's workload that day."}

There were some good ones.\n\nFor those who root for Tom Brady, congratulations. For those of us who don't root for Tom Brady, well, I mean, we're kind of running out of things to say and/or do. The man just keeps on winning and it's starting to feel like it's just going to keep happening for eternity. Brady, who now plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, locked up his 7th Super Bowl (the most of any player ever) in his first season since leaving the New England Patriots.\n\nLast year's champion Kansas City Chiefs and their incredible young QB Patrick Mahomes seemed to be a good match for Brady and the Bucs, but that turned out to not be the case; Brady was formidable on offense, particularly when hooking up with his old pal Rob Gronkowski, but it was the way Tampa's defense, led by Defensive Coordinator Todd Bowles, stifled the Kansas City offense that powered the Bucs to their win in the big game.\n\nSuper Bowl LV was exciting for some, and frustrating for many, but at least there's one thing from the game's aftermath that can bring people together: funny memes and tweets. Some may just have to acknowledge Brady's undeniable greatness, while others can make fun of a bit of the man's corniness. It's all fair game in love and memes.\n\nLet's take a look at some of our favorites.\n\nSure, Tom Brady won another Super Bowl. But at least that makes for an excuse to make a little fun of his old New England Patriots coach, Bill Belichick.\n\nRobert Horry, an NBA champion with the Lakers and Spurs and one of the most underrated winners in sports, shouted Brady out for matching his own seven rings.\n\nSomeone else with 7 rings? Ariana Grande, who has a banger of a 2019 single called, yes, \"7 rings.\"\n\nDoesn't it feel like we've been hearing about Brady throwing to Gronkowski in the Super Bowl for decades at this point?\n\nIt just feels all too familiar...\n\nHe's also old.\n\nHe may not even be the most important QB on his own team! (Yes, this is a joke.)\n\nAnd, let's be real, it did feel like some of the penalty calls got a bit one-sided at certain points.\n\nSometimes, sorry, Brady is just an easy target.\n\nWe can also get a little existential with all of this if it will make anyone feel any better.\n\nIt also brought up a bit of conversation about some other G.O.A.T.S.\n\nLeBron James (age 36) recognized a fellow athlete with, let's say, seniority.\n\nLindsey Berra (granddaughter of baseball legend Yogi Berra) made a good point: no one's really touching Yogi just yet.\n\nBut as much as we make fun, it's really kind of impossible to deny the man's achievements at this point.\n\nUntil next year, NFL fans, we're just going to have to deal with Brady as the reigning champ again. Just more motivation for an extra fiery offseason, if you ask this guy."}

He had delivered an electrifying first-half performance, paving the way for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 31-26 victory over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship.\n\nBut when asked about the magnitude of his accomplishment -- leading Tampa Bay to its first Super Bowl since 2002 -- and his decision to bet on himself and the Bucs, Brady preferred to deflect.\n\n\"This is an ultimate team sport,\" Brady said. \"We've had a lot of people work hard over a course of time to get to this point. It's a tough journey to get here, so to go on the road, win another road playoff game is a great achievement.\"\n\nAgain, Brady was asked about his journey, from face of the six-time world champion New England Patriots for 20 years to hitting the reset button with a previously 7-9 team that had the NFC's longest playoff drought. But he kept focusing on everybody else.\n\nHe praised head coach Bruce Arians and his coordinators, Byron Leftwich, Todd Bowles and Keith Armstrong. He praised the young playmakers on both sides of the ball.\n\n\"It has taken a lot of people on all sides of the ball to come through ... just an incredible journey for all of us,\" Brady reiterated. \"And I'm proud to be a part of it.\"\n\nBrady's responses came from a place of appreciation. Because here he is, in the twilight of his career, nearly a year after the coach and team he gave his heart and soul to for two decades no longer valued what he had to offer, taking for granted how he elevated those around him. And here he is, 43 years old and surrounded by everything he could have ever asked for:\n\nAn organization that craved him so much they kicked their former first overall pick to the curb to make room for him.\n\nA head coach who greatly respects him and offensive coordinator who welcomes his input.\n\nAn offense full of talent rather than New England's bare cupboard -- an offense full of deficiencies that Brady was asked to compensate for by his former coach.\n\nA game-changing defense that could ease the load and at times clean up the messes that he made.\n\nAs perfect as Brady has been for the Bucs, they have been just as perfect for him.\n\nBrady wasn't ready to be put out to pasture, as it seemed Bill Belichick desired in those latter years in Foxborough. The quarterback still loved the game too much, still had too much left to prove and still wanted to win. That's why he was willing to put himself through the arduous task of starting from scratch as he entered a 21st NFL season.\n\nTampa's players and coaches afforded him the opportunity to achieve all of his goals. And he would be able to pursue each without having to do it all on his own.\n\nOf course that didn't mean Brady took his foot off the accelerator. He continued to work just as hard and demand just as much. He set a tone for the Bucs, who are hungry to taste true success for the first time in many of the players' careers.\n\n\"He's at the helm, he's our leader and he's the reason why we're as good as we are,\" wide receiver Scotty Miller said. This season, Miller more than doubled his production from a year ago and on Sunday caught one of three Brady touchdown passes. \"He makes it easy to get behind him. His composure. We know he's going to get it done. He had a couple picks, but we know when the game is on the line, he's going to make a play.\""}

Why I back Bill Belichick in the Tom Brady vs. the coach debate\n\nFOXBORO — Rodney Harrison is upset.\n\nI don't blame him. The question, which I asked, was unfair. I even acknowledged as much.\n\n\"Who deserves more credit for the Patriots' success — Tom Brady or Bill Belichick?\"\n\nIt's a debate that's raged on for a while now, but it's heated up recently. It's easy to understand why. Brady left the Patriots and won a Super Bowl without Belichick. As soon as that happened, people declared Brady the winner.\n\nBrady 1, Belichick 0.\n\nNow, on Sunday, we have Brady returning with his reigning Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers to take on Belichick's 1-2 Patriots squad. Hence the reason why the topic has come up again, and it's understandable that it seems Brady is getting the bulk of the credit. Without Brady, Belichick's Patriots finished 7-9 in 2020. Without Brady, Belichick is 63-75 in his career.\n\n'It wasn't a question of not wanting him': Belichick says he never wanted Brady to leave\n\nIn reality, those numbers are misleading. Football isn't about one person. It's not about one coach. It's about 11 players on offense and 11 players on defense. It's about teamwork. It's about \"doing your job\" to accomplish higher goals.\n\nThat's why Harrison is upset.\n\n\"I think it's stupid, OK?\" Harrison replied to our question. \"I think it's disrespectful. Not only is it disrespectful to Tom and Bill, but it's disrespectful to all those great players that came along that were part of those championship teams because, at the end of the day, it wasn't Bill and Tom versus everybody else. It was an entire team. ... I just think it's dumb.\"\n\nHarrison makes a fair point. The Patriots didn't win six Super Bowls just because of Brady and/or Belichick. There are hundreds of players who helped bring those championships to New England. Where would the Pats be without Adam Vinatieri? Or Malcolm Butler? Ty Law? Julian Edelman?\n\nWhen the Pats won their last Super Bowl, the offense scored just 13 points. That's the worst scoring output by a Super Bowl winner in NFL history. The real story of that win over the Los Angeles Rams was the team's defense that allowed three points — that's also an NFL Super Bowl record.\n\nFrom the coach: Belichick denies talk of a bad relationship with Brady\n\nFootball is the ultimate team game.\n\nThe problem is, I disagree, slightly, with Harrison and mostly everyone on this topic."}

After looking below average in his first two starts, Brady found his stride, leading the team, which started 0-2, to an 11-5 record. In the Super Bowl, the Rams scored to make it a 17-17 game with 1:30 remaining. Brady led a drive down the field with no timeouts, setting up a game-winning 48-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri as time expired. Despite lackluster numbers, the 24-year-old Brady was named the game's MVP.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXVIII\n\nWhen: Feb. 1, 2004\n\nFinal: New England Patriots 32, Carolina Panthers 29\n\nLocation: Reliant Stadium, Houston, Texas\n\nCrowd: 71,525\n\nBrady's line: 32-for-48, 354 yards, 3 TDs, 1 INT\n\nSignificance: After missing the playoffs the prior year, Brady and the Patriots rolled to a 14-2 record. The Super Bowl was scoreless after one quarter, with Brady collecting just 43 yards passing. However, in the second quarter, Brady passed for 101 yards and a touchdown, including a 52-yarder to Deion Branch. In the fourth quarter, Brady connected with linebacker Mike Vrabel, who was in as an eligible receiver, on a 1-yard touchdown pass. For the second time, Brady was named the game's MVP.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXIX\n\nWhen: Feb. 6, 2005\n\nFinal: New England Patriots 24, Philadelphia Eagles 21\n\nLocation: Alltel Stadium, Jacksonville, Florida\n\nCrowd: 78,125\n\nBrady's line: 23-for-33, 236 yards, 2 TDs\n\nSignificance: Brady connected with his favorite early-career target Deion Branch for a then Super Bowl-tying record 11 receptions for 133 yards. Branch would be named the game's MVP. Brady also would again connect with linebacker Mike Vrabel on a touchdown. And for the third time in four years, the Patriots won a Super Bowl by three points, each being won by the foot of Adam Vinatieri.\n\nSuper Bowl XLII\n\nWhen: Feb. 3, 2008\n\nFinal: New York Giants 17, New England Patriots 14\n\nLocation: University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Arizona\n\nCrowd: 71,101\n\nBrady's line: 29-for-48, 266 yards, 1 TD\n\nSignificance: After a two-year Super Bowl absence, Brady and the Patriots returned to the game with perhaps their best team yet. They were 16-0 during the regular season and won two playoff games leading up to the Super Bowl. However, a stifling Giants defense and a just-good-enough Eli Manning shocked the Patriots, handing Tom Brady his first Super Bowl loss and allowing the 1972 Miami Dolphins to continue as the only undefeated team in league history.\n\nSuper Bowl XLVI\n\nWhen: Feb. 5, 2012\n\nFinal: New York Giants 21, New England Patriots 17\n\nLocation: Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nCrowd: 68,658"}

This Sunday, January 17, the New Orleans Saints take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC's Divisional round. But it's not about these NFL franchises so much as who is leading them now and what they have accomplished. In short, the buzz is about two legendary quarterbacks squaring off.\n\nThe Saints' Drew Brees, the all-time leader in passing yards (80,358) and completions (7,142), will take on longtime New England Patriots QB and new Bucs leader, Tom Brady, who sits second in both all-time passing yards and completions (with 79,204 and 6,778).\n\nLike most of us, longtime News York Giants quarterback Eli Manning says he'll be tuned in for the big face-off too. The four-time NFL Pro Bowler, who spent his entire career with the Giants, won two Super Bowls with them—Super Bowls XLII and XLVI, both against Tom Brady and the Patriots.\n\nSince retiring after the 2019 season, Manning has kept a mostly quiet profile, especially if you compare his activity to that of his very outgoing brother, former Denver Broncos quarterback and fellow two-time Super Bowl champ Peyton Manning. Over the years, Eli Manning has been involved in his share of charity work and has sat on the previous administration's President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. He's also been a brand ambassador for such well-known names as Citizen Watch Co., Toyota and NFLShop.com.\n\nRelated Article: Jerome Bettis says NFL still a running back's game\n\nAnd with the annual march to the NFL's biggest game, you'll likely see Manning take to his old stomping ground at MetLife Stadium, along with former Giants teammate Victor Cruz, to talk Super Bowl game day food ideas for Stella Stadium Bites, a partnership involving beer mega brand Stella Artois and food kit maker Blue Apron APRN .\n\nEarlier today, I spoke with the 15-year NFL veteran about his thoughts on the NFC Playoffs, his past rivalry with Tom Brady and the Patriots, and what it's like to be part of the Manning Family football dynasty.\n\nAndy Frye: This weekend the buzz is on the Saints-Bucs game, with Tom Brady versus Drew Brees. You've played against both these guys, so what's your take?\n\nEli Manning: It's a great matchup and they've already faced each other twice this season, but both quarterbacks are playing great football right now. Even with his injury, Drew has come back and played great last week. And Tom is doing the same. They both have all their weapons and have come back healthy. Both defenses are playing well, and so it will be interesting how it plays out.\n\nIt's amazing what both those guys are doing at 40-plus years old, still playing at such a high level.\n\nRelated Article: Why NY Giants' Zak DeOssie Left Football For Wall Street\n\nAF: You beat Brady twice in the Super Bowl. What was your mindset like in those games, and how did you lead your team to beat the Patriots?\n\nManning: Well, it's really easy to beat them. You just have to have Michael Strahan, Justin Tuck, Osi Umenyiora and Jason Pierre-Paul on the defensive line—guys like that—making a bunch of sacks, and it shouldn't be a problem at all."}

Here's a quick rundown on (some of) the Super Bowl records that Brady holds:\n\nTom Brady's Super Bowl records\n\nWins — 6\n\nGames played — 9\n\nMVP awards — 4\n\nPass attempts — 392\n\nPass completions — 256\n\nPass completions in a single game — 43\n\nPassing yards — 2,838\n\nTouchdown passes — 18\n\nAmazingly, there are still a few records that don't have Brady's name on them. Here are three more he can break on Sunday:\n\nRecords Tom Brady can break at Super Bowl 55\n\nMost NFL championships\n\nBrady is already the player with the most Super Bowl rings (six), but if you include the pre-Super Bowl era then he's currently tied with three others — Fuzzy Thurston (Colts/Packers), Forrest Gregg (Packers/Cowboys) and Herb Adderly (Packers/Cowboys) — for the most NFL championships.\n\nInterestingly, the other three men did it with two teams each while all of Brady's titles came with the Patriots. If he wins on Sunday, he'll not only take sole possession of first place but he'll also get to add a second team that he's done it with.\n\nMost touchdown passes in a single Super Bowl\n\nThis is one of the few QB records Brady hasn't yet claimed, although it's once again on the table — especially with Sunday's game expected to be a shootout between the Bucs star and his counterpart, Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nBrady's personal best is four touchdown passes at Super Bowl XLIX, which places him in a tie for third place with Terry Bradshaw, Doug Williams and Troy Aikman. In second place is Joe Montana, who connected for five TD passes at Super Bowl XXIV.\n\nMontana's successor, Steve Young, currently holds the record with an astonishing six TD passes in Super Bowl XXIX.\n\nMost interceptions\n\nThis is really just a product of playing in so many Super Bowls, and it's obviously not something Brady will be striving for.\n\nBrady's thrown six interceptions in the nine games he's appeared in, which puts him in fourth place all time (tied with former Vikings pivot Fran Tarkenton). The leader is John Elway, who has eight INTs to his name (five games), while Craig Morton and Jim Kelly each had seven picks (in two and four games, respectively).\n\nThe fact that he's played nearly double the number of games as Elway yet still trails in this department is a testament to Brady's dominance on the grandest stage."}

Others are anonymous role players whose contributions went mostly unnoticed by outsiders.\n\nThere are veterans who joined up for one final run at the title, and wide-eyed rookies who were thrust into the Super Bowl spotlight.\n\nTheir first names range from A to Z with eight guys named Brandon — a ninth named Brandin — and five guys named Kyle.\n\nThey all are part of the Brady Bunch, the 218 players who have appeared in a Super Bowl as Tom Brady's teammate in his record nine previous trips to the title game with New England. That list will grow by more than 40 names next Sunday when Brady plays in his 10th Super Bowl and first with his new team in Tampa.\n\nOf those players who have been part of Brady's supporting cast, 164 got a Super Bowl ring out of the trip, accounting for nearly one-quarter of the players who were on a winning team in the Super Bowl since Brady became a starter in 2001.\n\nSome went along for the ride and barely made an impact on those six titles Brady won. Others delivered the key plays that decided those games, whether it was Malcolm Butler's game-sealing interception at the goal line against Seattle, or Adam Vinatieri's inning kicks against St. Louis and Carolina.\n\nHere's a look at some of them:\n\nMost appearances\n\nNo one has played in more Super Bowls with Brady than Stephen Gostkowski, who went with him six times during their tenures in New England. Rob Gronkowski can join a group right behind Gostkowski this year with his fifth appearance, matching the number for Matt Light, Devin McCourty, Patrick Chung and Matthew Slater.\n\nThere are 26 players who have played in three Super Bowl wins as Brady's teammates, with Gronkowski hoping to join that group this year. Gronkowski played in Super Bowl wins following the 2014 and '18 seasons but missed the epic comeback against Atlanta following the 2016 season with an injury.\n\nHall of Famers\n\nThree of Brady's Super Bowl teammates have already been inducted into the Hall of Fame with more likely to come down the road. Ty Law, who played on the first three title teams in New England, was inducted to the Canton, Ohio shrine in 2019 and is the only one of the three to get there based mostly on their careers with Brady.\n\nRandy Moss and Junior Seau joined up with Brady late in their careers and both made big impacts during the perfect 16-0 regular season in 2007, but came up short in their only trip to the Super Bowl.\n\nRichard Seymour is a Hall of Fame finalist this year and others such as Gronkowski, Vinatieri and Darrelle Revis could follow in upcoming years.\n\nLeading men\n\nBrady has completed passes to 37 players in his nine previous Super Bowl trips, with a few standing out as his favorite targets. Julian Edelman and Deion Branch, who both won Super Bowl MVPs with Brady, are tied for the most catches with 24 apiece. Edelman's 337 yards are 16 more than Branch for the most of any of Brady's targets.\n\nGronkowski could pass them this year as he comes into the game with 23 catches for 297 yards. He already has the most TD catches from Brady with three, one ahead of David Givens, Danny Amendola and linebacker Mike Vrabel.\n\nGostkowski has the most points scored alongside Brady with 33, but two other players have more significant scores. James White scored 20 of his 26 career Super Bowl points in the comeback win over Atlanta four years ago, including the TD that helped force overtime and the OT winner.\n\nVinatieri is next with 20, including the field goals that won the title in Brady's first two trips."}

Survey says rename Super Bowl MVP trophy for Tom Brady\n\nI recently wrote a column positing this question: Should the Super Bowl MVP Trophy be renamed for Tom Brady, who has now won the trophy five times?\n\nIt was accompanied by an informal survey.\n\nThe trophy currently is named for late NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle.\n\nBrady has played in 10 Super Bowls, won seven and was named the game's MVP five times.\n\nThe big question: Should Super Bowl MVP Trophy be renamed for Tom Brady?\n\n199th pick: What you need to know about Tom Brady\n\nForget Tom Brady's tweets: Former Tampa Bay Bucs coach John McKay is the G.O.A.T. of quotes\n\nRozelle essentially built the NFL into what it is today and helped created the Super Bowl. There's no question of his greatness.\n\nHowever, I wondered if an award won by a player should be named after a player?\n\nThe Super Bowl Trophy is named after Vince Lombardi, the first coach to win a Super Bowl. So why shouldn't the Super Bowl MVP trophy be named after a player?\n\nWe'll get to the results in a minute, but first I wanted to share some of the great feedback as to why some people agreed, and why some didn't.\n\nTom from Ohio, would like to see the trophy renamed, sharing this thought: \"It's not the Most Valuable Commissioner award?\"\n\nDerrick from Virginia agreed but offered this on how to continue to honor Rozelle: \"The Rozelle Trophy should be for the coach or general manager of the year. Or franchise of the year award.\"\n\nRozelle had his defenders.\n\nJim from Massachusetts stuck up for Rozelle then made the most common argument I received against renaming the trophy: \"First, it would be extremely disrespectful to Pete Rozelle. More importantly, Tom Brady was found guilty and sanctioned by the league for his role in cheating. That's not someone that should have a trophy such as this named after him. Some of his cheating helped him achieve what he has.\"\n\nJim, of course, references the 2015 controversy where footballs in an AFC Championship game were found to be under the NFL's gauge pressure requirement. Brady was suspended the first four games the following year after a lengthy investigation.\n\nOthers chimed in to say yes and refute the Deflategate argument, pointing out the Wells report convicted Brady with statements like: \"The investigation concluded that it was 'more probable than not' that New England Patriots equipment personnel were deliberately circumventing the rules.\"\n\nThat's an argument for another day.\n\nThe most common response for renaming the trophy for Brady was simply, \"He's the GOAT.\"\n\nThat phrase has become a bit tired and overused during the past few weeks, but in this survey it was used dozens of times.\n\nAnother common suggestion was summed up well by Rich in Venice, Florida: \"I'd wait until TB12 retires and then, after 5 years, rename it.\"\n\nMany didn't think it was a good idea to rename it while he was still playing.\n\nChris from North Carolina took it a step further with a \"no\" vote — for now: \"That decision should not be considered until Tom is enshrined in the Hall of Fame .. it is important to respect the history of the game ... but great idea.\"\n\nI had to make sure those last three words got in there.\n\nMatt from Indiana is against it despite being a fan: \"I love Brady but he did not win the Super Bowls by himself. The Bucs defense was the main reason why they won the game this year. Brady is one of the greatest QB's ever... but please do not change the name.\""}

Super Bowl LV Doesn't Leave Broncos Fans With Good Options\n\nBroncos fans, there is no God.\n\nSorry to break the news, folks.\n\nWhat's my proof, you ask? Well for starters, God would never inflict torture on his people.\n\nThe kind of torture Broncos fans will have to endure during Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nI'm being dramatic, you say? Well, let's examine the evidence:\n\nOn one side, you have the Kansas City Chiefs. As in the same Chiefs who are among the Broncos' archrivals in the AFC West. Denver and KC have had some knock-down, drag-out wars over the last several decades and there is no love lost between the two teams.\n\nOn the other sideline, we have the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, whom Broncos fans might not have had an issue with had TOM BRADY not signed with the team last year.\n\nYes, that Tom Brady. As in, the Broncos longtime nemesis who is ridiculously too handsome, married to a supermodel and has more Super Bowl rings than I have teeth!\n\nIt's evil versus evil. Both teams may as well make the \"Star Wars Imperial March\" their entrance music when they take the field.\n\nAnd Broncos fans can't do nothin' about it, either. We just gotta sit there helplessly while two of our fiercest enemies go at it in the biggest game of the year.\n\nSee. There is no God.\n\nI recently posted a poll on Twitter this week asking Broncos fans if they'd be rooting for the Chiefs or Tom Brady in the big game. About a third of respondents said they refuse to root for either team!\n\nMy sister Julie Thuis, a die hard Broncos fan, is in that category.\n\n\"I mean, do I really want to hear, 'Tom Brady has now won Super Bowls in the AFC and NFC and look at this, he's the greatest of all time and blah blah blah blah?'\" my sister said, who added a couple of choice words for Brady that you can't say on the radio ... or in print.\n\n\"But I also don't want Kansas City to go back-to-back. So pretty much I'm screwed,\" she said.\n\nYep, if Kansas City wins Sunday they'll have won two Super Bowls in a row, something that's only happened twice since 1998 and 1999, when the Broncos went back-to-back, and again in 2004 and 2005, with the Patriots ... who were led by ... yeah, you know who I'm talking about.\n\nWhile many Broncos fans say they're conflicted over their rooting interest Sunday, Christine Voss of Denver isn't one of them.\n\nVoss is a Colorado native. She's such a huge Broncos fan that she has the coordinates of the 50-yard line at the Broncos stadium tattooed on her wrist. She'll be rooting for Tampa Bay.\n\n\"I mean, it's not a choice,\" Voss said. \"A divisional rival is not any team I'm ever going to cheer for. It's anyone but the Chiefs and anybody but the Raiders — who would never be there. But there's no choice in my mind.\"\n\nUp until last year, the Broncos were able to say they were the only AFC West team to win a Super Bowl since the 1983 Raiders. But now the Chiefs, led by 25-year-old quarterback sensation Patrick Mahomes, threaten to blow past Denver's success during all those years the Broncos dominated the division.\n\nBesides, Voss says, Broncos fans really don't have an axe to grind with Tom Brady anyway.\n\n\"He does not have a winning record against the Broncos,\" she said. \"In the playoffs, he especially has not been able to challenge them. I mean, we hated Tom Brady because he was so good and we hated the Patriots. But that's not a rivalry.\"\n\nThat's a really good point. In fact, mostly recently, when the Broncos last won the Super Bowl five years ago, they beat Tom Brady and his former team, the Patriots, to get there.\n\nSo, Broncos fans, why all the Brady-hating?\n\nWell, Dave DeNovellis of Denver has a lot to say about that.\n\n\"He's basically the Voldemort of the NFL,\" DeNovellis said, comparing Tom Brady to the \"Harry Potter\" villain with the maniacal laugh.\n\nDeNovellis said that ain't even the worst part about Brady.\n\n\"He trademarked the term 'Tom-pa Bay.' As in T-O-M-P-A Bay,\" he said. \"That's just ridiculous.\"\n\nYes, when Tom Brady joined the Buccaneers this season, he in fact applied to trademark the phrases \"Tompa Bay\" and \"Tampa Brady\" with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nI'm not kidding.\n\nThat's something perhaps even Voldemort wouldn't do.\n\nFormer State Rep. Cole Wist grew up on the Western Slope rooting for the Broncos to stomp teams like Kansas City. But now, he's begrudgingly backing the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. When he replied to my Twitter poll he used the hashtag, #NeverBrady.\n\n\"On the one hand, I appreciate that the guy is 43-years-old and is playing at this level,\" Wist said. \"On the other hand it irritates the crap out of me.\"\n\nBut seriously, Broncos fans are having a really hard time picking sides. Twitter user LibPatriot said, \"I'm rooting for the commercials.\" SM Lindberg wrote, \"My husband is rooting for a cancellation. I entered the Volvo sweepstakes, so I'm rooting for a safety.\"\n\nA friend of mine who reports for the Albuquerque Journal, Kyle Land, said, \"I literally can't bring myself to root for either (team). Just wishing baseball season would start already.\"\n\nThat's a real sore subject for Rockies fans right now, though. So let's not even go there.\n\nBut some of you had a good idea! When in doubt, maybe root for the team with the most Colorado connections. For Kansas City, there's offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, who played college football for the Colorado Buffaloes. The Chiefs also have Mike Pennel, who went to CSU-Pueblo.\n\nBut Ryan Jensen, who also played football at CSU-Pueblo, plays for Tampa Bay. As does CSU's Shaq Barrett. So that might be a wash.\n\nOr, you can just root for the underdog, like Christine Voss is doing.\n\n\"You know, this football season was so exciting,\" Voss said. \"It was exciting seeing the Bills and Browns get as far as they did. So I'm all for the underdog story. So, remove Tom Brady from the equation. Like, sure I don't wanna see his face. Like, no one does.

(He is also dad to 13-year-old son John \"Jack\" Edward with ex Bridget Moynahan.)\n\n\"She's the one that, you know, supports the family and, at the end of the day, makes a lot of sacrifices,\" he added. \"She brings out the best version of me.\"\n\nBrady also spoke about keeping his children \"grounded\" as they grow up, making sure that they know they'll have to \"work hard\" in life.\n\nHe explained, \"Mom and Dad's life is very unique in this world. I don't want them to take those things for granted. I want them to make the impact in the world that they're gonna make. But they're gonna make it in their way, too.\""}

Now we know he a lot more than an arthroscopic procedure in February.\n\nBrady tore the anterior cruciate ligament in the same knee during Week 1 of the 2008 season.\n\nThe MCL is a band of tissue that runs along the inner edge of the knee. It helps to connect the shin and thigh bones to keep the knee stable and working properly during movement.\n\nThe risk of playing with a torn MCL is that the knee can become hyperextended easily and bend in the wrong direction. Brady uses his left knee to step into his passes.\n\n\"It was an injury I dealt with really since last, you know, April, May,\" Brady said following the Bucs' mandatory minicamp in June. \"I knew I would have to do something at the end of the year, and happy I did it, and it was probably something that certainly needed to be done, and there was a great outcome, so I'm very happy about that.\n\n\"I feel like there's some things I'll be able to do this year that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\n\nBrady missed about one practice each week the final few months of the 2020 season, presumably to give his ailing knee rest.\n\nHe was good enough to pass for 4,633 yards, with 40 touchdowns and 12 interceptions while leading the Bucs to an 11-5 record during the regular season.\n\nHe added 1,061 yards passing, 10 touchdowns and three interceptions in four postseason games, including the Super Bowl at Raymond James Stadium."}

It's more of a tight-knit group definitely.\"\n\nFlagg participated in many sports and activities in New Hampshire, but he really enjoys the snow. \"I'm a huge skier,\" Flagg said. \"Me, my family and all my friends, in the wintertime it was just that.\"\n\nGrowing up in New England, being a Brady and Patriots' fan was only natural for Flagg. \"When (Brady) was on the Patriots, it was a whole team thing,\" Flagg said.\n\nFlagg has many great Patriots and Brady memories to choose from, but his favorite occurred in 2017.\n\nThe Patriots played the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, and Flagg threw a watch party in Tampa.\n\nThe Patriots came back from a 28-3 deficit to stun the Falcons, 34-28.

(AP) — Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl throwing to Troy Brown, Jermaine Wiggins and David Patten and earned his seventh ring firing passes to Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski.\n\nThere's a significant talent gap between his first crew of journeymen in New England and the all-star cast he has in Tampa Bay, but the common theme is No. 12.\n\nBrady won with Deion Branch, David Givens, Brandon LaFell, Malcolm Mitchell, Chris Hogan and Danny Amendola, and he helped Julian Edelman and Wes Welker become stars.\n\nHe's relied on throwing to his running backs from J.R. Redmond and Kevin Faulk to Shane Vereen and James White. His tight ends have always been favorite targets from Wiggins, Daniel Graham and Benjamin Watson to Aaron Hernandez, Martellus Bennett and Gronkowski.\n\nBrady's best receiver along the way was Hall of Famer Randy Moss. They broke records together and went 16-0 in 2007 but didn't win it all.\n\nThe 44-year-old, five-time Super Bowl MVP faces the Patriots on Sunday night for the first time since leaving New England after 20 years. He'll see plenty of familiar faces on the opposite sideline, including his leading receiver from their first Super Bowl victory two decades ago.\n\nTroy Brown caught six of Brady's passes for 89 yards when the Patriots stunned the \"Greatest Show on Turf\" Rams in Super Bowl 36. Brown now coaches New England's wide receivers and kick returners.\n\n\"I played with the guy for a long time and coached with him for a couple of years while he was here,\" Brown said. \"It's a little bit awkward, but at the end of the day, it's still about competing and going against each other. That's what it comes down to. I mean, I know I'm not playing, but still, you're approaching the game as we do every other team around the league, is that we do everything we can to prepare for what they have. We'll approach this game the same way, not because Tom Brady is Tom Brady or whatever it is, because it's the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. We have a really good football team all around.\"\n\nBrown isn't surprised Brady is still playing at an elite level all these years later. The GOAT already has 10 touchdown passes in three games, putting him on pace to set a new career high. He threw 50 TD passes, including 23 to Moss, in '07.\n\n\"Well, I think if anybody can pull it off, it would be Tom Brady,\" Brown said. \"He's been that type of guy his entire career. No reason to think that he wouldn't still be playing. He said when he came into the league that he would play forever. And so, he's trying to make that come true, I guess.\"\n\nWiggins had two catches for 14 yards in New England's first Super Bowl win. The Boston native can't believe Brady switched teams.\n\n\"I still haven't been able to get over it since he left here. I never thought I'd see it coming where he'd be wearing another uniform,\" Wiggins said. \"Brady I thought would be that guy that I thought the only uniform he would wear would be the New England Patriots one. Then when he left, it was weird to see him in that Tampa Bay uniform. To this day I can't get used to it because that championship he won down there I feel like could have been another one he won in New England.\"\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick said earlier this week he didn't want Brady to leave.\n\n\"He looked at his options and made his decision. We weren't as good of an option as Tampa,\" Belichick said on his weekly radio appearance on WEEI. \"You'd have to ask him about all that, but it wasn't a question of not wanting him, that's for sure.\"\n\nBrady wouldn't elaborate on a report that Belichick spoke to him on the phone instead of meeting with him in person when he was a free agent last year."}

Brady entered the game needing just 68 yards to surpass former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who has since retired and is now working for NBC.\n\n\"Guys did a great job catching for me the last 22 years, all of 'em which I hope ... felt a little piece of happiness tonight, watching that, because everybody contributed,\" Brady told NBC Sunday Night Football reporter Michelle Tafoya. \"I sure as hell can't catch anything, everyone's seen that drop against the Eagles in the Super Bowl.\"\n\nBrady is jokingly referring to the Patriots' trick play during the second quarter of the Super Bowl, where he flanked out as a receiver but dropped a wide-open pass during a trick play. Pouring salt into Brady's wound was Eagles quarterback Nick Foles, who hauled in a touchdown pass later in the game during the famed \"Philly Special\" play.\n\nIt's not the first time Brady has recalled the loss to the Eagles. During the Facebook documentary series Tom vs. Time, Brady revealed the most difficult part of losing that Super Bowl was watching his kids cry, and opened up about the late fumble caused by Brandon Graham that essentially sealed the Eagles victory.\n\n\"I thought we were going to go down and score. I thought we were going to win the game,\" Brady said. \"I thought about that play 500 times in five days.\"\n\nGotham Chopra, director of the Tom vs. Time documentary series, thought Brady and the Patriots were going to win, revealing in a Facebook post following the game that the loss to the Eagles forced the production team to rethink the series' final episode.\n\n\"The truth is we had a plan, but unconsciously, it was tied to the Pats winning the Super Bowl and, when that didn't happen (congrats, Eagles!), I felt like we needed to pause and recalibrate,\" Chopra wrote.\n\nBrady also opened up about the loss ahead of the 2019 rematch against the Eagles during an interview on SportsRadio 93.7 WEEI in Boston.\n\n\"You assume I'm over it? Come on now,\" Brady said. \"That's a lot of mental scar tissue from that year. That was a tough game...They deserved it that year.\"\n\nBrady will face the Eagles for the first time since joining the Buccaneers on Thursday Night Football on Oct. 14, but the situation will obviously be a lot different. The Buccaneers are riding high at 3-1, while the Eagles are 1-3 and hoping to avoid their fourth-straight loss of the season Sunday against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nBrady-Belichick draws massive ratings on NBC\n\nLooks like the Brady-Belichick bowl lived up to the hype.\n\nThe Buccaneers' win over the Patriots on Sunday Night Football drew about 27.2 million viewers to NBC, the broadcast's largest audience since 2015, according to Sports Media Watch's Jon Lewis. The broadcast averaged a 34 share, meaning 34% of all households with televisions were tuned into the game, a new record for Sunday Night Football.\n\nThe exact ratings will be released Tuesday morning.\n\nWhile impressive, especially considering the decline of cable subscribers over the past few years, the game didn't come close to breaking into the top five regular-season broadcasts of all time (four of which were Thanksgiving games featuring the Dallas Cowboys):\n\nNetwork Window Game Date Time Viewers Network ABC Window MNF Game Giants-49ers Date 12/3/90 Time 9 p.m. Viewers 41.5 million Network NBC Window Thanksgiving Game Dolphins-Cowboys Date 11/25/90 Time 4 p.m Viewers 38.4 million Network NBC Window Thanksgiving Game Chiefs-Cowboys Date 11/23/95 Time 4 p.m Viewers 35.7 million Network FOX Window Thanksgiving Game Washington-Cowboys Date 11/24/16 Time 4:36 p.m. Viewers 35.1 million Network CBS Window Thanksgiving Game Vikings-Cowboys Date 11/26/87 Time 4 p.m. Viewers 34 million"}

And according to Brady, such an outcome never even crossed his mind.\n\n\"First of all, I was not thinking at that moment. It was not a thought. It was, 'This seems really fun to do,'\" Brady told James Corden during an appearance on The Late Late Show. \"Not to mention, when you get your hands on one of those trophies, there's a lot of really sharp edges on the bottom. ... I found out later, had that been an incomplete pass, that would have went down like 80 feet. I'm so happy that (tight end) Cam (Brate caught it).\"\n\nMaterial items are just that, and can be replaced, but the thought of Brady's first Lombardi won without Bill Belichick ending up at the bottom of the Hillsborough River is still frightening. Such a reality crossed the mind of at least one person: Brady's 8-year-old daughter, Vivi, who could be heard on the video shouting \"Daddy, no!\"\n\n\"Who could imagine that an 8-year-old girl would have the most sense of anybody in that whole area?\" Brady said. \"I mean, she's the voice of reason. Go figure.\"\n\nShe isn't the only voice attempting to reason with Brady these days. The quarterback recalled his experience immediately after his Buccaneers had secured the franchise's second Super Bowl triumph in its history, a moment in which Brady searched for his family on the field. With his children arriving first, Brady's wife, Gisele, followed closely behind, embracing the quarterback before dropping a hint.\n\n\"All of a sudden I saw my wife and I gave her a big hug, and just as I did it, she says 'what more do you have to prove?'\" Brady recalled with a chuckle.\n\nWhat more does Brady have to prove, after all? He's won more Super Bowls than any other player in NFL history, he's almost universally revered as the greatest to ever play the position, and his latest triumph proved he wasn't solely reliant on or a product of the Patriot Way. But as Brady described to Corden, playing football to him is like running on a treadmill at high speed for six months before it comes to an abrupt stop.\n\nBrady told Corden he tried to change the subject quickly when his wife asked him that question, and the reason is clear: Brady doesn't want to stop running, because he doesn't want to get rid of the treadmill."}

How Tom Brady and Matthew Stafford each got to their respective teams is somewhat of a football miracle, but in this timeline the Rams and Bucs look like the two most dangerous teams in the NFC in large thanks because of their quarterbacks.\n\nHow Stafford and Brady were viewed as draft prospects is like comparing apples to sixth round picks but it's always been a marquee matchup whenever the two quarterbacks are playing in the same game. So far, that's only happened twice, with each player winning once, but there were two other near-opportunities that didn't quite happen.\n\n2010 - Stafford sits out\n\nThe first close encounter came in 2010, Matthew Stafford's second season in the NFL.

Detroit was first against the run and they hadn't given up more than 24 points to any opponent. The Lions 7-3 record at the time was actually considered by some to be a sign that Stafford was holding Detroit back from being a better team.\n\nThat day would not turn out to be Stafford's redemption story, as he went 18-of-46, threw an interception, and the Lions lost 34-9. And to this day, legend has it, the 39-percent completion rate he posted against New England is the lowest of his career.\n\nTom Brady threw for 349 yards, the most by a quarterback against the Lions all year.\n\nDetroit safety James Ihedigbo feigned confusion when a reporter asked if teams had \"figured out\" their defense.\n\n\"What? What are you talking about?\" Ihedigbo said. \"We're the No. 1 defense, what are you talking about figured us out? What does that mean? I don't get it.\"\n\nThe Detroit Free Press also notes in the post-game article that Lions receivers dropped three touchdown passes against the Patriots. Said Stafford:\n\n\"You play a good team like New England, the whole team has to play well and we didn't.\"\n\nThe Lions ended up winning the next four games and made the playoffs at 11-5, losing in the wild card round to the Dallas Cowboys, 24-20.\n\nThe Patriots won the Super Bowl.\n\n2018 - Stafford gets redemption, and Matt Patricia borrows some of it from him\n\nDetroit and New England would meet again in 2018 and this time the face-off that everyone was talking about was first-year Lions head coach Matt Patricia against his old boss Bill Belichick.\n\nThe Lions were 0-2 and facing the Patriots on Sunday Night Football, but Stafford was prepared for the moment. Stafford said before the game that he wasn't focused on Brady, but on New England's defense:\n\n\"(I) just want to go out there and play my best for my team, and no doubt it'll be against their defense and not him. But they're just a really good football team, so we're looking forward to playing against a really good football team,\" he said."}

At the moment, the extra spot goes to the linebackers, with outside linebacker Cam Gill and rookie inside linebackers K.J. Britt and Grant Stuard all making it.\n\nThe Buccaneers retained six of their seven 2021 draft picks, with the exception being seventh-round cornerback Chris Wilcox. The only undrafted rookie still on the roster after Tuesday's cuts is kicker Jose Borregales, who handled the placekicking duties in the preseason finale at Houston with Succop unavailable.\n\nListed below is how the initial 53-man roster breaks down, with the players listed alphabetically at each position (rookies marked with an asterisk). We've also included the four players currently on the reserve/COVID-19 list, some or all of whom could be activated to the 53-man roster in the coming week.\n\nQuarterbacks (3): Tom Brady, Blaine Gabbert, Kyle Trask*\n\nThe Buccaneers kept Trask, a second-round draft pick and possibly an eventual successor to Brady, over long-tenured but little-used veteran Ryan Griffin. Gabbert is likely to be the primary reserve for Brady in 2021, however.\n\nRunning Backs (4): Giovani Bernard, Leonard Fournette, Ronald Jones, Ke'Shawn Vaughn\n\nOne of the few new veterans on the roster, Bernard appears to have carved out a significant role as a third-down back, while Fournette and Jones remain essentially co-starters. Vaughn, the 2020 third-round pick, helped his cause for the fourth spot in the backfield by finding a role on special teams as a gunner.\n\nWide Receivers (6): Antonio Brown, Jaelon Darden*, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Tyler Johnson, Scotty Miller\n\nThere was little surprise in the top five receivers retained with the starting trio of Evans, Godwin and Brown backed up by promising young players Johnson and Miller. Darden appears to have beaten out Jaydon Mickens for the return job, thus securing the sixth spot. The Bucs cut Mickens, Cyril Grayson and Travis Jonsen to get down to six and any or all of those three could be top candidates for the practice squad.\n\nTight Ends (3): Cameron Brate, Rob Gronkowski, O.J.

Hungry. Those were the words the GOAT used to describe the moment he became a Tampa Bay Buccaneer one year ago.\n\nJust days after the pandemic was made official and Florida began closing businesses, one story became a welcomed distraction for Tampa Bay fans: Tom Brady signed with the Buccaneers on March 20, 2020.\n\nA bigger distraction took place in February when the Buccaneers became the first team to win a Super Bowl in their home stadium.\n\nBefore Brady and the team made the announcement, rumors were swirling that the Bucs were going to make an offer the quarterback couldn't refuse. Days before it was made official, demand for season tickets spiked.\n\nIt's been quite the whirlwind in \"Tompa Bay,\" ever since.\n\nBecause of the pandemic, Brady didn't receive a traditional introduction to Tampa Bay. Instead, the team introduced him via a video conference call, during which he explained that his decision to leave the New England Patriots came after some deep thought and research.\n\n\"I'm not going to make predictions on how the next couple of months are going to go and I don't really know what's going to happen,\" Brady said at the time.\n\nThe NFL offseason started like no other with no in-person training, but after months of teasing fans, the Bucs used the time to unveil new uniform combinations inspired by the set the team wore when they won their first Super Bowl in 2002.\n\n\"We are excited to return to our classic Super Bowl era uniforms,\" Ed Glazer, the team's owner and CEO, said in a statement following the reveal.\n\nLittle did they know, history would repeat itself.\n\nIt wouldn't be until the following month when the Bucs showed their quarterback in red, pewter, and white colors.\n\nIn the same month, Rob Gronkowski announced he will come out of retirement and return to the NFL as a Buccaneer to play alongside Brady. He had initially retired from the league in March 2019, citing injuries, and signed with the WWE.\n\nIt turned out, he was \"not totally done\" with football, Gronkowski said last year.\n\nAround that time, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor dropped some news that the city's newest resident, Brady, was caught working out in a city park that was closed at the time due to COVID-19 regulations.\n\nShe wanted to make it clear that he was sighted, not cited.\n\nIt wasn't the only notable moment during Brady's early days as a Buc. He also accidentally broke into someone's house.\n\nAt the time, Brady believed he was walking into the home of offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich, but it turned out he walked into the home of his next-door neighbor.\n\nIt was a minute-and-a-half encounter that David Kramer would never forget. To this day, he still retells the tale.\n\n\"[Brady] goes, 'I'm so sorry sir, I'm sorry.' And he's gone like lightning,\" Kramer recalls.\n\nBack in April, the NFL legend joked on Twitter saying, \"Trespassing in parks, breaking and entering... Just making myself at home in Tompa Bay!\""}

Leftwich's response, in part, was this:\n\n\"I've got to put these guys in position to do the things that they need to do to give ourselves an opportunity to win the football game.\"\n\nLeftwich shared that thought, in some form or another, many times during the 2020 season, which ended with the Buccaneers hoisting the Lombardi Trophy after a Super Bowl LV victory over Kansas City. Essentially, he's saying that he and the coaching staff have to devise a game plan that would counter the opposing defense's strengths and take advantage of its weaknesses, and then it was up to the players to execute it. Like most coordinators, Leftwich didn't feel the need to share what that game plan was before the game itself took place.\n\nThe Buccaneers had an offensive game plan for the Chiefs now seems very clear in retrospect. It centered on effective play-action fakes and getting the ball out of Tom Brady's hand quickly. Thanks to good execution of that plan by the players, it worked. The result was a smooth and mistake-free offense that, at one point, scored on five of six consecutive drives, with the other one ending at Kansas City's one-yard line. The result was a dominant 31-9 win and the second championship in franchise history.\n\nThe heavy usage of play-action in the passing game was pretty easy to spot during the game and later confirmed by NFL Next Gen Stats. According to Next Gen, Brady executed a play-action fake on 43% of his dropbacks. Next Gen has been tracking this and many other things since 2016 and that is the single-highest rate of play-action usage that Brady has had in a game in that span.\n\nThis was the plan right from the start, and it was a new one. As a team, the Buccaneers either ran the ball or faked a handoff – what Next Gen Stats calls \"run action\" – on 73% of their plays in the first quarter, their highest rate in any game this season. Over the season as a whole, the Bucs used run action on just 48% of their first-quarter plays.\n\nBrady ended up throwing 13 passes after a fake handoff and he completed 10 of them for 135 yards and all three of his touchdowns. Those numbers produce a near-perfect passer rating of 149.0. Obviously, those fakes are meant to move defenders in the wrong direction, and that's exactly what they did. At the point of the catch or incompletion, Brady's targeted pass-catchers had an average of 4.0 yards of separation from the nearest defender. That's the best average separation the Buccaneers got in any game during the entire 2020 season."}

In fact, some fans waited for more than an hour behind 5,000-6,000 others to order seats.\n\nThe highest increase, however, reflects the elimination of about 3,000 seats in the 300 level which used to be offered at half price to youths.\n\n\"2020 was a magical season for our fans and organization that started with the arrival of Tom Brady along with Rob Gronkowski and many other top free agents and concluded with a history-making win in Super Bowl 55 at home in Raymond James Stadium,\" said Bucs Chief Operating Officer Brian Ford.\n\n\"Over the past few seasons, we have invested more than $150 million in stadium renovations at Raymond James Stadium to ensure that it remains one of the country's premier NFL stadiums. Along with those major improvements, we also routinely review our ticket pricing to ensure that our members receive unrivaled value and that we are aligned with pricing models throughout the league.\n\n\"Despite a marginal price increase for 2021,\" Ford continued, \"we still offer one of the most affordable average ticket prices in the NFL, with access to games starting as low as $40.\"\n\nDue to the pandemic, the Bucs' home games were played before a limited number of fans last season, capacity at Raymond James Stadium topping out at around 15,600.\n\nIn their letter to season pass members, Arians and Licht called winning a Super Bowl during a pandemic a \"daunting task.\"\n\nThe Bucs are hopeful their fans can fill the 65,000-seat stadium. Of course, this increase may seem modest compared to the secondary market for Bucs tickets next season.\n\n\"Now we turn our focus toward the much-anticipated 2021 season, when Raymond James Stadium will once again be filled with our great fans and provide the type of home-field advantage that our team so desperately missed for much of last season."}

In fact, he's been more late-game clutch than overall dominant, even in winning four Super Bowl MVPs.\n\nHere is our ranking of his first nine Super Bowl performances:\n\n1. Super Bowl LI: Patriots 34, Falcons 28 (2016)\n\nIt was on pace to be Brady's worst Super Bowl in the third quarter, when the Patriots trailed 28-3 and the quarterback's most noteworthy play was throwing a pick-six. But he orchestrated the biggest Super Bowl comeback in the first one ever to go to overtime by completing 43-of-62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBrady completed third-down passes to three different receivers on the game-tying 91-yard touchdown drive — then capped it with a must-have 2-point conversion pass. The halftime adjustment to target 1-on-1 coverage outside the numbers was brilliant.\n\n2. Super Bowl XLIX: Patriots 28, Seahawks 24 (2014)\n\nYou remember Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception, but did you forget the Patriots' 10-point fourth-quarter comeback?\n\nUndeterred by the dark cloud of Deflategate and an unthinkable decade-long championship drought, Brady was 37-of-50 for 328 yards and four touchdowns with two interceptions. But he was 13-of-15 for 124 yards with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter against the NFL's top-ranked defense, anchored by its secondary.\n\n3. Super Bowl LII: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 (2017)\n\nLike the only other quarterback ever to throw for 500 yards in the playoffs — Ben Roethlisberger, three weeks ago — Brady lost. Unlike Roethlisberger, Brady wasn't piling up meaningless stats.\n\nBrady took shots down the field in completing 28-of-48 passes for 505 yards — including 237 yards while throwing under pressure — and three touchdowns with no interceptions. But he was strip-sacked by Brandon Graham in the closing minutes of a shootout.\n\n4. Super Bowl XXXVIII: Patriots 32, Panthers 29 (2003)\n\nGraduation day! The end of knocking Brady as a game-manager came when he led two scoring drives in the final four minutes of the first half and two more in the final three minutes of the second half. He threw for 354 yard and three touchdowns — one of which claimed the lead with three minutes to go — on a then-record 32 completions.\n\nAfter the Panthers tied the score with 68 seconds left, Brady set up Adam Vinatieri in range for the winning field goal.\n\n5. Super Bowl XXXVI: Patriots 20, Rams 17 (2001)\n\nWho is this guy? He was the backup who replaced Drew Bledsoe early that season.\n\nBrady's final numbers were those of a caretaker: 16-of-27 for 145 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. But his legend was born in the final 90 seconds, when the great broadcaster John Madden suggested the Patriots should play for overtime. Brady completed five passes — including a 23-yarder to Troy Brown — to set up the last-second field goal.\n\n6. Super Bowl XXXIX: Patriots 24, Eagles 21 (2004)\n\nThe win that cemented the dynasty.\n\nDonovan McNabb had the gaudy stats (357 yards, three touchdowns) but made the mistakes (three interceptions) his counterpart did not. Linebacker Mike Vrabel caught one of Brady's two touchdown passes, and favorite target Deion Branch exploded for 11 catches, 133 yards and MVP honors.\n\n7. Super Bowl XLVI: Giants 21, Patriots 17 (2011)"}

Brady, already the oldest player to earn a championship ring at age 43, is now signed to play with the Buccaneers through at least age 45.\n\nThe seven-time Super Bowl champion confirmed the news on Instagram, sharing a picture of himself signing the new contract.\n\n\"In pursuit of 8...LFG @buccaneers we're keeping the band together,\" he captioned the photo.\n\nThe Buccaneers also posted the photo to their official page as well as a video of Brady running on the field during Super Bowl LV last month.\n\nSeveral of Brady's friends and teammates expressed their excitement for his return in the comments of his post.\n\n\"Let's Go!!!! ❤️,\" Brady's wife, Giselle Bündchen, wrote.\n\n\"Yessir,\" added Bucs outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett, while linebacker Devin White replied, \"Let's Get Live Then 🤠💪🏾\"\n\nSuper Bowl LV was Brady's 10th time playing in the annual event, but first time as a Buccaneer.

The NFL star shares son Benjamin Rein, 11, and daughter Vivian Lake, 8, with Bündchen and 13-year-old son John \"Jack\" Edward — who mainly lives in New York — with ex Bridget Moynahan.\n\nBrady was named MVP for Super Bowl LV after leading the way for Tampa Bay's offense, helping the team earn a 31-9 victory against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAhead of his Super Bowl win with the Bucs, Brady spoke about his thoughts on retirement and shared that he would continue playing football until the timing is right.\n\n\"Yeah, definitely,\" Brady said when asked if he would play past age 45. \"It's a physical sport and the perspective I have on that is — you never know.\"\n\n\"You never know when that moment is, just because it's a contact sport and there's a lot of training that goes into it. And again, it has to be 100 percent commitment from myself to keep doing it.\"\n\n\"I think I'll know when it's time,\" he added, per CBS Sports. \"I can never go into this game half-ass.\"\n\nElsewhere in the press conference, Brady said that when the day for retirement does come, it will be hard to walk away from the sport.\n\n\"It's been a huge part of my life for a long time, and I love thinking about it. I think football to me is much more than just a sport because there's the physical element, there's a mental approach, you know, how you're going to get the job done, and there's the emotional part,\" he said, adding that \"as a quarterback, it's never about what I do, it's really about what we do.\""}

(Sort of, Graham played 10 seasons, won seven titles so you do kind of have to tell me why, if rings are all that matter, Graham's not the best quarterback of all time.)\n\nTom Brady won his seventh title Sunday. If that's all that matters to you — and that's a pretty good argument — then he's the greatest quarterback of all-time.\n\nPeyton Manning will almost certainly be announced as a hall of famer on Saturday night. The argument of who is better is closer than you think.\n\nBrady vs. Manning by the numbers\n\nAn average season for Manning was an 11-5 record, completing 65.3% of his passes for 4,231 yards, 32 touchdowns and 15 interceptions with a 96.5 passer rating. Brady is at 12-4, completing 64.0% of his passes for 4,210 yards, 31 touchdowns and 10 interceptions with a 97.3 passer rating.\n\nManning set the single-season touchdown passes record with 49 in 2004, Brady threw 50 in 2007 then Manning had 55 in 2013. Manning owns the passing yards record with 5,477 in 2013 and his passer rating of 121.1 in 2004 is No. 3 all-time. Brady has the third-most passing yards in a season (5,235 in 2011) and his 117.2 passer rating in 2007 is sixth all-time.\n\nIrsay: Colts 'looked into' Tom Brady last offseason before signing Philip Rivers\n\nBrady is No. 1 in passing touchdowns (581), No. 2 in passing yards (79,204) and seventh in passer rating (97.3). Manning is No. 3 in passing yards (71,940), No. 3 in TDs (539) and 11th in passer rating (96.5). Manning's passer rating is 17% better than the league average during his career, Brady's 15%. (Sid Luckman was 58% better than the average quarterback during his career, by the way.)\n\nManning's biggest edge on Brady is his seven first-team All-Pro seasons, Johnny Unitas is next at five among quarterbacks. Brady had three. Manning also won a record five MVP awards, Brady three. For the people following the sports the closest during their careers, Manning was better than Brady during the regular season.\n\nEdge: Manning. Brady's rate statistics will continue to drop if he plays until he's 45 but he's continued to be a high-quality quarterback. Manning's peak was better so he gets the nod.\n\nManning vs. Brady head-to-head\n\nManning was just 6-11 versus Brady with an 87.7 passer rating but New England was the best team in the NFL during that stretch. Brady was, of course, 11-6 against Manning, with a 92.8 passer rating. Manning lost his first six games to Brady and the Patriots, which means he won 6 of the last 11, including two playoff victories.\n\nEdge: Brady. This is probably closer than most fans realize, but the advantage is clear.\n\nManning vs. Brady in the postseason\n\nIt's easy to point to Manning's playoff record -- 14-13 -- versus Brady's -- 34-11 -- but we need to go a little deeper than that. Manning has the edge in completion percentage (.632 vs. .627) but Brady is ahead on touchdowns (83 vs. 40, with an edge per game) and they each average slightly less than one interception per game.

AP Photo/Darron Cummings\n\nIn the seventh episode of the Tom Brady documentary, \"Man in the Arena,\" the 44-year-old quarterback's family receives some focus while the story of the 2016 Patriots is recounted.\n\nInterwoven with details about one of New England's most celebrated championships—culminating with the comeback from a 28-3 deficit in Super Bowl LI — Brady's three older sisters chronicle both his career and growth off the field from their unique perspective.\n\nMaureen, Julie, and Nancy Brady joined their brother to be interviewed for the episode, discussing the team's on-field success simultaneous to the more personal story of their mother battling cancer.\n\nHere are a few takeaways from Episode 7, titled, \"Surrender\":\n\nThe Brady family view of \"Deflategate\"\n\nAfter receiving coverage in the previous episode, the \"Deflategate\" controversy was once again back in the documentary as Brady's 2016 four-game suspension was discussed.\n\nIn Brady's view, the entire subplot was \"a lot about who had power and authority.\"\n\n\"What it started out as vs. what it became were two totally different things,\" he explained.\n\nBrady's siblings shared that view, noting that accusations drifted over time as the initial reports of discrepancies in the pressure of footballs were seemingly disproven by the ideal gas law.\n\n\"A lot of people were waiting for that moment to kind of dig in,\" said Nancy. \"It was vicious.\"\n\nUltimately, Brady believed that it wasn't productive to continuously defend his actions.\n\n\"I don't need to defend myself,\" he said. \"I've defended myself for a long time. I said what I had to say multiple times, in front of a lot of different people, in court, in public. I felt I had given them what they needed to make the right decision, but I feel like they had their mind made up.\"\n\n\"I realized I wasn't going to win,\" Brady said of the protracted court procedure. \"It's hard to beat 31 billionaires in court. I thought we gave it a great fight but in the end just dealing with the results of what the New York circuit judge decided. I decided to put that behind me and then move on to the next year.\"\n\nBrady's response to his mother having cancer\n\nWhile the 2016 season was ultimately a happy memory for Patriots fans, it was a difficult time for the Brady family. When asked what came to mind about the year, Maureen became emotional.\n\n\"That was a hard year,\" she recalled. \"That was a really hard year. We had a lot going on with my mom and Tommy.\"\n\nGalynn Brady was diagnosed with breast cancer and myeloma in 2016. She immediately began to receive treatment, which eventually meant a difficult period of chemotherapy.\n\nBrady offered an introspective recollection from that time.\n\n\"I tried to remain poised and say, 'Don't worry, mom, we're going to get through it,'\" said Brady. \"And then I automatically — maybe it's a little bit of a toughening up that I've had, but maybe I'm not the most empathetic or sympathetic — I'm trying to solve it.\n\n\"I'm saying, 'Mom, come on, this is what we've got to do, we've got to send you to this person, or this person,'\" Brady continued. \"We're going to fix this.\"\n\nHandling the 2016 suspension\n\nHaving to serve a four-game suspension at the outset of the 2016 season provided a stark change of pace for Brady.\n\n\"It was the first September that I'd had off since my eighth-grade year,\" Brady recalled. \"I didn't even know what a September was like without football.\n\nBrady said that he decided to go on vacation to Costa Rica to be with his wife.\n\n\"That was really good for our relationship,\" he said of the trip with Gisele Bündchen.\n\n\"A very small gesture like that allowed me to recognize the things that I need to do in our relationship to make sure that she feels supported too,\" said Brady, \"because she'd supported me for the previous year and a half. She held me up when I was weak and angry and sad and depressed. That was a really dark time.\"\n\nBut after the brutal period of \"Deflategate,\" the suspension that finally resulted from it was a positive moment.\n\n\"It actually worked out awesome for them,\" said Maureen. \"He saw our family. We haven't had a family holiday together since he was at Michigan.\"\n\nWatching Jimmy Garoppolo start the season at quarterback\n\nBrady said he was working out while watching backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo and the Patriots play the Cardinals in the opening game of the 2016 season."}

Graham began his NFL coaching career in New England from 2009-15, a stretch in which Brady and the Patriots won the AFC East title all seven seasons, the conference championship twice and Super Bowl XLIX.\n\nGiven that experience, Graham was asked if it would have been more advantageous for the Giants had Brady thrown five touchdowns in a victory last week and not entered this game looking to make amends for an unsatisfactory performance in an unexpected defeat. Graham's response was, in essence: no way.\n\n\"I was around him for seven years, every week is different for him,\" Graham said. \"I don't know anybody that's more competitive, more serious about the game and, on top of that, he's a great person. I mean, if they won by 20 touchdowns or if they lost, it doesn't matter. If he's playing the New York Giants on Monday night, that's where his focus is and it's laser focus. If you had a chance to be around him, it's laser focus, truly. To be around one of the best to ever play the game and just see that focus – I mean, I remember practicing against him – it just makes you have to raise your level as a coach because he'll take advantage. If you don't have it fixed, he's going to take advantage of it. I don't think that will play into it at all really, not with him at all, I don't think so.\"\n\nWhen these teams met last season on a Monday night in MetLife Stadium, the Buccaneers had won two in a row and five of their previous six games. The Giants jumped out to a 14-6 halftime lead. But Brady threw second-half touchdowns to Ron Gronkowski and Mike Evans and when the Giants came up short on a late two-point conversion attempt, Tampa Bay won, 25-23.\n\n\"Tom's going to figure it out,\" Graham said. \"I mean, you look back at the tape to try to have a reference point because, again, most of their offense is the same offense. They're the only team in the league to come back with all 22 starters. There are some different pieces, so you look back to have a reference point there, but each game is so different and Tom, B.A. (coach Bruce Arians), and (offensive coordinator Byron) Leftwich, they're all treating it as it's a different game."}

Joe Montana and Steve Young combined to win five Super Bowls and won four MVPs between them.\n\nMontana and legendary receiver Jerry Rice dominated the NFL during Montana's tenure as the starter. The pair connected for 386 receptions, 6,710 yards and 67 touchdowns in 77 games.\n\nMontana was widely regarded as the best quarterback in NFL history until Tom Brady came along and won six Super Bowls over the past 20 years. The 43-year-old Brady — who is playing his first season with the Buccaneers — helped Tampa get to this weekend's NFC Championship game against the Green Bay Packers. This will be the 14th time Brady is the quarterback on one of the final four teams.\n\nRice joined 95.7 The Game's The Morning Roast and was asked about who he would want as his quarterback with the game on the line between Montana and Brady (h/t 49ers Web Zone):\n\n\"I'm going to go with Joe Montana because, like I said, it was a different era. Not taking anything away from what's happening today, but you look at the game today, the way it's played, you look at how receivers are protected — I never thought I would see an era where the running back doesn't have to be on the ground for them to stop the play because this, to me, is supposed to be tackle football. So, it's a whole different era, and I would go with Montana any day because he was Joe Cool, and he was in an era where he was not as protected.\"\n\nIt's no surprise to see that Rice chooses Montana. He's always been loyal to the 49ers. Rice is also correct when bringing up the differences in how the game is played. It's a long video, but check out some of the hits players took in the 1980s (some of the footage looks like it was shot with a 1980s Fisher Price kids camera):\n\nIn today's NFL, you might get a 15-yard penalty for sneezing near the quarterback. Brady has only suffered one significant injury in his career when he tore his ACL and MCL in Week 1 of the 2008 season. Bernard Pollard's hit on Brady resulted in the NFL changing its rules to protect quarterbacks.\n\nMontana played during an era where a player could get steamrolled by a defender without any consequences, so no one was letting up when they were attacking the QB.\n\nMontana only started all 16 games twice during his 16-year career, while Brady suited up for every game 17 times in 21 seasons. He missed four starts because of suspension in 2016.\n\nBoth quarterbacks have a ton of playoff success on their resumes.\n\nHere is how Montana and Brady's postseason stats look (per Pro Football Reference):\n\nMontana: 16-7 record (.695 win%), 62.7 completion percentage, 251 yards per game, 7.0 adjusted net yards per attempt, 45 touchdowns, 21 interceptions, 4-0 record in the Super Bowl, three Super Bowl MVPs."}

But what could have happened if he called it a career after the 2019 season?\n\nThe Saints were always going to stick with Brees if he decided to run it back. If Brees would return it was going to be in a Saints uniform or no uniform at all. And that's what ended up happening. An injury-plagued year season for Brees consisted of a torn rotator cuff, torn fascia, 11 broken ribs, and a collapsed lung, that only held him out four weeks. Brees recently said at a local golf tournament this summer that the only game he was feeling 100% healthy for was against the Detroit Lions. If Brees was healthy, there is no doubt the season could have looked a lot different, but at the end of the day, he was not.\n\nSo what could have happened if Brees stepped away and started his announcing career with NBC one season early. First off, who would have started at QB for New Orleans in 2020? A source inside the Saints building said that Tom Brady had a major interest in New Orleans if in fact Brees had retired.\n\nESPN reporter Jeff Darlington said on \"Get Up\" this Tuesday, \"I think that people still underestimate how close Tom Brady was to signing with the New Orleans Saints up until he ultimately decided on the Bucs,\" Darlington said. \"I know that that's gonna be a statement people try to question. It's the truth.\"\n\n.@JeffDarlington takes a look at Tom Brady's comments about being snubbed by teams in free agency\n\nBrady was keeping close tabs on New Orleans, but other teams such as the Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angels Chargers were in the race but pulled out late. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers since Day 1 were committed on Brady and once Brees said he was returning, Brady signed with the Buccaneers. Recently on the HBO show The Shop: Uninterrupted, Brady said \"You're sticking with that motherf–ker?\" - talking about a team choosing their current starter over him. It is unclear who that team was, but it's unlikely he was referring to New Orleans."}

The average football fan, by now, knows the improbable tale, of a skinny kid from Michigan drafted 199th overall who became the greatest NFL player ever.\n\nBut all the analysis, and glowing stories, and drooling commentators fail to capture just how improbable Brady's accomplishments are. Set aside his sixth-round status for a second. What is the probability that a given drafted player would go on to win seven Super Bowls?\n\nAfter Brady won Ring No. 7 on Sunday night, Yahoo Sports set out to answer that question. We asked sports statistics professors, a major sports data analysis firm and others far smarter than us. We settled on an overly theoretical answer: The odds of a given player winning seven-plus Super Bowls are about the same as your odds of winning the Powerball jackpot if you bought five or six lottery tickets.\n\nThe observed probability is 1 in 26,683. That's the number of professional football players in Pro Football Reference's database. And only one of them has now won seven championships.\n\nBut the classical, theoretical probability?\n\nRoughly 1 in 51.8 million. Or 0.0000019%. Or 19 in a billion.\n\nThe math behind Tom Brady's improbability\n\nHow'd we calculate that? We started by narrowing the question: Put yourself back in April 2000. Exactly 254 players are about to be picked in the NFL draft. If you were to randomly select one of those players, without knowing anything about how his life would transpire, what is the probability that player would win seven-plus Super Bowls?\n\nTo answer, we pulled data on career length from Pro Football Reference. We made the (overly simplistic) assumption that an average player's Super Bowl odds in a given season are 1/32. And we asked stats whiz Vince Jansen to build a model that would tell us the likelihood of a random player winning at least seven rings.\n\nThe model showed that the theoretical probability of winning at least one Super Bowl was 15.38%. But at least seven? 0.0000019%.\n\nThe actual math is ridiculously complex – think equations with 80-plus characters. But multiple statistics professors confirmed its validity to Yahoo Sports. Thomas Severini, a statistics professor at Northwestern University, suggested framing the results with a different question: How many players would need to be drafted for there to be a 50% chance of one winning at least seven Super Bowls?\n\nThe answer, he says, is roughly 36 million.\n\nAnd three experts – including Severini and Mark Glickman, a statistics professor at Harvard – independently came up with another mind-blowing number: Even if you were to guarantee that the randomly selected player would have a 21-year NFL career, the theoretical probability of that player winning seven-plus Super Bowls is 1 in 435,119 – or 2.3 in a million.\n\nIn other words, an average NFL player who spent 21 seasons in the league would have a 0.00023% chance of doing what Tom Brady has done.\n\nWhat if we specify 'quarterback'?\n\nThe first caveat to those minuscule probabilities is that they wouldn't be quite as small once we know that the random player is a quarterback. QB careers last longer than the average player's. They're more likely to yield several Super Bowls.\n\n\"If it's not a quarterback, it's not gonna happen,\" says Abraham Wyner, a stats professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.\n\nSo we made a second set of calculations. Rather than use the 2000 draft class as our sample for career-length data, we used all QBs drafted from 1985-2004. The probability that one of them would win seven or more Super Bowls?\n\nRoughly 1 in 12.8 million. Or 0.0000078%. Or 78 in a billion.\n\nSo, four times more likely – but still ridiculously improbable.\n\nThe one major caveat\n\nThe more important caveat is that the assumption mentioned above – that the player's Super Bowl odds in a given season are 1/32 – isn't a realistic one."}

Brady is a prominent endorser of Under Armour, a Nike competitor.\n\nOn the field, Brady wears Under Armour cleats, and an Under Armour glove on his left hand. The NFL has an apparel and equipment contract with Nike. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' uniforms, like those of every other team, are made by Nike. Their undershirts, and now their \"SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS\" t-shirts, have Nike logos on them.\n\nBrady – likely aware how much brand visibility matters to sports apparel companies, especially on a stage as big as the Super Bowl's – perhaps realized that a quick shirt adjustment could make his appearance Nike-free.\n\nDid Brady pull a reverse Jordan?\n\nBrady isn't the first athlete to make a branding move on a celebratory podium.

When the men's basketball team – popularly dubbed the \"Dream Team\" – won gold, Michael Jordan was forced to wear a Reebok warmup jacket onto a podium for the medal ceremony.\n\nJordan, a celebrated Nike endorser, found a workaround. The entire team half-unzipped their jackets to cover up the Reebok logo. Jordan, Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson draped American flags over their shoulders to be absolutely sure that the Reebok logo wouldn't be seen.\n\nIt's unclear how much thought Brady put into the shirt lift.

Howard missed a Super Bowl season but gained so much more\n\nTAMPA — The Achilles rupture required nine months to completely heal. The remedy for his heartbreak took just as long to develop.\n\nBut the timely arrival of his infant daughter may have been the only thing that helped O.J. Howard overcome the most bittersweet year of his life.\n\nNow Howard is learning that he can play football and be a father at the same time, and neither game needs to suffer.\n\nHoward was off to the best start of his career last season with 11 catches for 146 yards and two touchdowns. In fact, he helped spur a 21-point comeback against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 4 with three receptions for 50 yards, including a touchdown.\n\nBut with 11:05 remaining in that Oct. 4 game and needing a touchdown to take the lead, Howard was the first option for Tom Brady on a slant route. Brady looked Howard's way but saw him stumble, then came back across the field and connected with rookie running back Ke'Shawn Vaughn for the go-ahead touchdown.\n\nHoward tried to walk it off but couldn't.\n\n\"Tom was looking to throw me the ball. He looked at me when I came out of my cut,\" Howard said. \"When I planted to cut on the slant, it felt like someone kicked me. I never fell to the ground. I put my hand on the ground to brace myself, and I never could get the sensation back in my foot. I was like, 'Man, somebody hit me really hard.'\n\n\"And that's when I remembered the Kobe Bryant interview, the Kevin Durant interview when those guys said (an Achilles tear) felt as if someone kicked them.\"\n\nA blessing follows desolation\n\nAt 6-foot-6, 251 pounds, Howard had never really been hurt until he entered the NFL as the 19th overall pick in the 2017 draft by the Bucs. Before the Achilles injury, he had never had surgery of any kind.\n\nAn ankle injury put Howard on injured reserve the final two games of his rookie year.

A deep look into the reasons each of the 43 Republican senators gave for their vote holds some lessons.\n\nIn this article, we provide the text for each of the 43 senators' statements (where available) and classify those statements according to whether the senator took a position on the merits of the case against Trump. Some senators clearly voted in support of Trump's defense against the allegations. Other senators, however, indicated that the House Managers proved their case but that the senator did not vote to convict on the theory that the Senate lacked jurisdiction to try a former president. Other senators gave no indication of their views on the merits, but also said the Senate lacked jurisdiction to decide. Indeed, one of the implications of this analysis is that, as a matter of law, it is technically inaccurate to call many of these 43 senators' decisions a vote to \"acquit,\" at least not on the question of guilt or innocence. Indeed, over half of the 43 senators were either critical of Trump or expressed neither criticism nor support for him on the merits (e.g., Groups A, C & D below).

He limited and reduced federal regulations. He put conservatives — to the tune of over 200 federal judges — on the lower federal courts and three conservative members of the U.S. Supreme Court.

He built part of his wall on the southern border and attempted to reduce, and succeeded in reducing, illegal immigration.\"\n\nForecasting how historians will perceive and treat the 45th president decades from now is a risky endeavor. Perspectives change over time. Yet Perry and other students of politics agree that Trump's trial for inciting insurrection, which begins this week, will likely obscure or taint the most notable accomplishments achieved during his presidency.\n\nOne of his primary distinctions in the history books could be as the only president ever to be formally accused of, and tried for, fomenting rebellion against the government he led.\n\nHistoric proceeding\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives impeached the 74-year-old former president on January 13, charging him with inciting insurrection during an impassioned speech January 6 to supporters before the assault on the Capitol.\n\nTrump's followers wanted to stop a joint session of Congress from certifying Joe Biden's November 2020 election victory. Among the rioters were members of right-wing groups that embrace theories associated with white supremacy.\n\n\"It's a black mark on his record, and if he gets convicted, it's a serious black mark,\" says Susan Low Bloch, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center. \"It'll have a huge significance on his life because he won't be able to run again.

Rallying outside the White House, he unleashed a mob of supporters to \"fight like hell\" for him at the Capitol just as Congress was certifying Democrat Joe Biden's victory. As hundreds stormed the building, some in tactical gear engaging in bloody combat with police, lawmakers fled for their lives. Five people died.\n\nThe verdict, on a vote of 57-43, is all but certain to influence not only the former president's political future but that of the senators sworn to deliver impartial justice as jurors.

Trump has now been acquitted of inciting a riotous mob to attack the Capitol on January 6, an episode that interrupted the final tally of Electoral College votes that sealed Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHere are six takeaways from Trump's history-making trial:\n\nOffered an opening, Democrats let Trump off\n\nHouse Democrats forced Trump's second impeachment, presenting a compelling case that he incited an attack on the Capitol, and driving a wedge between Republicans willing to look the other way versus those abhorred by Trump's behavior.\n\nOn Saturday morning, after CNN's Jamie Gangel reported shocking new details about Trump's behavior on January 6, Democrats found themselves on the cusp of demanding true accountability. They were joined by five Republicans in an effort to call witnesses – especially Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, the Washington Republican who has been instrumental in calling out the Trump defense team's counterfactual claim that Trump opposed the rioters rather than cheering them.\n\nFinding enough Republicans to convict Trump was still going to be a high bar and the Democrats would have had to offer Republicans a chance to call their own witness. But rather than push ahead and exploit the opening, Democrats decided to enter a written statement from Herrera Beutler into the record, allowing the impeachment trial to proceed toward Trump's expected acquittal.\n\nHaving the trial over will help Biden get down to business. But it will leave Americans who hoped Trump could be blocked from future political office wondering what might have been if Democrats had been a little more ruthless in their protection of the Constitution.\n\nThe GOP is still Trump's party\n\nTrump once quipped that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters. (His lawyers subsequently pushed a claim in court that, as president, Trump couldn't be charged for doing that, either.) It turns out that he could also dispatch a riotous mob up Pennsylvania Avenue to attack the US Capitol – with his own vice president inside – and most Republican senators would stick by him.\n\nSeven Republican senators voted that Trump was guilty of incitement, but most Republicans argued that the trial itself was unconstitutional because Trump was no longer president, saying that fact trumped any evidence presented during the trial.\n\nIn moments of frustration with the GOP, Trump has mused about starting his own political party, but it doesn't seem he needs to. When his lawyers manufactured an alternate reality in which he was calling for peace as rioters sacked the Capitol, the Republicans who were among those targeted by the mob grasped at the lifeline. That they could watch video of Mike Pence's evacuation and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney's near-miss with rioters alongside Trump's words leading up to the riot and then vote to acquit him is just the latest evidence that Trump's sway over the party is far from diminished."}

They played a montage of out-of-context clips showing Democrats, some of them senators now serving as jurors, also telling supporters to \"fight,\" aiming to establish a parallel with Trump's overheated rhetoric.\n\n\"This is ordinary political rhetoric that is virtually indistinguishable from the language that has been used by people across the political spectrum for hundreds of years,\" declared Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen. \"Countless politicians have spoken of fighting for our principles.\"\n\nBut the presentation blurred the difference between general encouragement to battle for causes and Trump's fight against officially accepted national election results.

This impeachment, unlike his first, was bipartisan. All told, 10 Republican representatives cast their vote to impeach Trump.\n\nThis vote makes Wednesday's impeachment the most bipartisan impeachment of all time.\n\nTo be clear, 197 Republicans still voted against impeaching Trump. That shouldn't be too surprising, as only about 15% of Republicans nationally want Trump to leave office before his term is up next week.\n\nStill, the fact that so many Republicans got behind removing Trump from office is historic.\n\nOnly three other impeachments have ever taken place. They all tell a similar story: impeachments are almost always down the party-line affairs.\n\nDuring the impeachment of Democrat Andrew Johnson in 1868, no Democrats voted to impeach him.\n\nJust five House Democrats voted to impeach Democrat Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nAnd finally, no Republicans voted to impeach Trump in 2019.\n\nWhat makes the Trump vote even more amazing is that we're at a very high level of polarization right now. The Democrats who abandoned Clinton were all moderate Democrats. Two (Virgil Goode and Ralph Hall) would eventually switch parties and serve as Republicans.\n\nThere are very few moderate House Republicans right now. Rep. Liz Cheney and Rep. Tom Rice, who voted for impeachment, are certainly not what most objective observers would consider moderate.\n\nThe relatively high number of Republican defectors comes at a time when Trump's job approval rating with Republicans has dropped below 80% (though it is still well above 70%).\n\nFrom a statistical angle, it would have been unexpected if more Republicans went against Trump. Trump may be in a valley of Republican support, but he's still got a lot of it.\n\nMost Republicans hail from safe districts where there is a far greater chance of losing a primary than a general election. Two of the Republicans who voted yes (Rep. Don Newhouse and Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler) hail from Washington state, where there is the untraditional top-two primary system in which all the candidates regardless of party run against each other.\n\nThe only historical parallel to what happened on Wednesday is the abandoned impeachment of Republican President Richard Nixon in 1974. Nixon stepped down before the House could impeach him.\n\nAlthough no formal impeachment vote took place involving the entire House, seven of the 17 House Republicans on the Judiciary Committee voted for at least one article of impeachment against Nixon in July 1974. Keep in mind, there were a lot more moderate Republicans in the House in 1974.\n\nPerhaps as interesting as the divide within the Republican ranks is the uniformity within the Democratic ranks.\n\nNot a single Democrat voted against impeaching Trump. That's a record for an impeachment.\n\nIn 1868, an Independent Republican and Conservative Republican voted against impeaching Johnson.\n\nIn 1998, four Republicans voted against all the articles to impeach Clinton.\n\nAnd when it came to Trump's last impeachment, two Democrats voted against both articles and one voted present for both.\n\nThe fact that Democrats are unified makes a lot of sense. Neither of the Democrats who voted against impeaching Trump last time are still sitting Democratic members of Congress. One of those Democrats is now a Republican (Rep. Jeff Van Drew) and the other (Collin Peterson) lost re-election last fall. The member who voted present (Tulsi Gabbard) is no longer in Congress.\n\nFurther, the Democratic caucus is smaller than it was last go around with fewer moderate members overall.\n\nOf course, impeachment is just the first step in a two-step process.\n\nThe big question going forward is whether the Senate partisan divide mirrors that of the House. If it does, there will be a lot of votes against Trump – but still not enough to convict."}

The only president to be impeached twice has once again evaded consequences, though this time as an election loser shunted off the field of play to the jeering section, at least for now.\n\nIn a broadside against Trump every bit as brutal as that leveled by Democrats, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell declared the ex-president \"practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day\" with his \"unconscionable behavior\" and \"disgraceful dereliction of duty.\"\n\n\"The leader of the free world cannot spend two weeks thundering that shadowy forces are stealing our country and then feign surprise when people believe them and do reckless things,\" McConnell said.\n\nBut this was after he gave Trump an escape hatch for the ages, voting to acquit him on the grounds that the Senate, in his view, cannot legitimately try a president out of office.\n\nUntil the conclusion of the five-day trial, the noisiest man in America stayed silent, down in Florida. But the panic, terrified whispers of officials hiding from their attackers and the crack of a fatal gunshot played out on a big screen in the Senate chamber penetrated less than six weeks earlier by the Trump-flag-waving insurrectionists.\n\nThis time the case did not hang on a whistleblower in the bowels of the national security bureaucracy.\n\nThis was an impeachment driven by what people saw happen and by Trump's voluminous public rhetoric, heard that day, for weeks before, and after — until Twitter exiled him and he let his lawyers and supporters do the talking while the trial played out.\n\n\"We saw it, we heard it, we lived it,\" said the Democratic majority leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer. \"This was the first presidential impeachment trial in history in which all senators were not only jurors and judges but were witnesses to the constitutional crime that was committed.\"\n\nTrump's fanciful boast five years ago that he could shoot someone in the middle of New York's Fifth Avenue and still be loved by his followers was never, of course, put to the test in his presidency. But something like it was, on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nOn Jan. 6, he sent his followers down that street to the Capitol, where they committed their mayhem. And in the end, that did not cost him the loyalty of enough supporters in Congress to convict him on the charge of inciting an insurrection."}

Can a former president be impeached?\n\nAs the United States Senate opens its second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, senators will grapple with thorny political and legal questions, top constitutional lawyers tell Al Jazeera.\n\n\"An impeachment and a Senate trial are a unique constitutional procedure that is entirely in the control of the House and Senate,\" said Jan Baran, a US Supreme Court practitioner at Holtzman Vogel Josefiak and Torchinsky in Washington.\n\n\"Whether they do the right thing by impeaching or by convicting is ultimately within the judgement of the American public and the voters,\" Baran told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe US Constitution gives Congress the sole power to impeach and remove a president and bar them from holding future office for committing \"treason, high crimes and misdemeanors\". The courts have almost no say in how Congress proceeds.\n\nIn an impeachment, the House of Representatives acts like a grand jury and appoints managers to prosecute the charge. The Senate conducts the trial with individual senators acting as jurors and providing a forum for presentation of evidence and arguments.\n\nA two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to convict, a very high bar that has never been met for a president in US history.\n\nWhat has Trump been charged with?\n\nFormer President Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on a charge of \"incitement of insurrection\" after the US Capitol was invaded by his political supporters on January 6.\n\nTrump had hosted a rally of supporters near the White House on the same day Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's election victory. In a fiery speech, Trump had urged them to march on the Capitol.\n\nThe House article of impeachment charges that Trump gave a speech in which he \"reiterated false claims\" he had won the 2020 presidential election and urged the crowd to \"fight like hell\".\n\nThe crowd \"breached and vandalized the Capitol\", killing a police officer and injuring many more, and \"menaced\" members of Congress.\n\nThe article alleges Trump's prior conduct included \"efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the results of the 2020 presidential election\".\n\nAs such, the former president \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power and imperiled a coequal branch of government\", the House said.\n\nWhat has been the response of Trump's defence lawyers?\n\nTrump's lawyers are insisting he did not incite a riot at the US Capitol last month and argue that his impeachment by the House should be dismissed by the Senate.\n\nIn a pre-trial brief filed on February 8, Trump's legal team, Bruce Castor and David Schoen, offered a robust response to House Democrats' charges that the former president is guilty of \"incitement of insurrection\".\n\nTrump's lawyers argue that in addition to his remarks being protected by the US Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of speech, \"not a single word encouraged violence or lawlessness, explicitly or implicitly\".\n\nIn the brief filed on Monday, the lawyers offered a litany of evidence to bolster the arguments they filed last week in response to the House Democrats' article of impeachment, prosecuting Trump with \"incitement\".\n\nIs it unconstitutional to impeach a former president?\n\nAlthough it has never been done before, the consensus among legal experts is the House and Senate have authority to impeach a former US official, including a former president."}

Nor are other claims in the tweet.\n\nThe tweet was posted on Friday, two days after a Capitol insurrection by a mob of Trump supporters sparked a new impeachment push from House Democrats. As of early Monday, it had more than 181,000 retweets and 725,000 likes. It says the following: \"For those wondering if it's worth impeaching him this time, it means he:\n\n1) loses his 200k+ pension for the rest of his life\n\n2) loses his 1 million dollar/year travel allowance\n\n3) loses lifetime full secret service detail\n\n4) loses his ability to run in 2024\"\n\nFacts First: The tweet is inaccurate in multiple ways.\n\n1) Trump would lose his post-presidency pension only if both the House voted to impeach him and then the Senate voted to remove him from office; impeachment itself, without removal, would not result in Trump being denied any benefits.\n\n2) The law makes clear that presidents who have lifetime Secret Service protection never get a $1 million travel allowance.\n\n3) It is unclear that Trump would lose lifetime Secret Service protection even if the Senate voted to remove him and prohibit him from running.\n\n4) Even a Senate vote to remove Trump would not prohibit him from running in 2024; for the Senate to ban him from the presidency, it would have to hold an additional vote on this question.\n\nThe post-presidency pension\n\nTrump would not lose his pension if the House impeached him for his role in inciting the insurrection – just as he didn't lose his pension when the House impeached him in 2019 over his effort to use the US' relationship with Ukraine for his own political ends. Rather, under the Former Presidents Act, he would lose his pension only if the Senate voted to convict him and remove him from office.\n\nLots of average citizens use the word \"impeachment\" to refer to impeachment and removal, so we're not bashing Costiloe for this common error, but the statement is incorrect.\n\nPresidents who have not been impeached and removed are entitled to a lifetime pension equivalent to the annual salary of a head of an executive department. For Trump, like predecessor President Barack Obama, that would indeed amount to more than $200,000 per year.\n\nRunning in 2024\n\nNeither a second House impeachment nor even a Senate vote to convict Trump and remove him from office would prevent him from running again, in 2024 or beyond.\n\nRather, after two-thirds of senators present voted to remove Trump, a simple majority of senators present would have to approve an additional vote to bar him from the presidency in the future.\n\nThe Senate could not skip the conviction-and-removal vote that requires two-thirds of senators and go straight to the simple-majority vote for future disqualification, Ross Garber, an impeachment and political investigations lawyer who teaches at Tulane Law School, told CNN."}

The other 9 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have also faced a backlash.\n\nCNN — House Republicans ousted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming on Wednesday from her leadership post as conference chair after she repeatedly called out former President Donald Trump's \"Big Lie\" that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nThe move sends a high-profile message about the Republican Party's priorities, its ongoing loyalty to the former President and the limited extent to which it is willing to tolerate dissent even after Trump's election lies incited a deadly attack on the US Capitol.\n\nPrior to losing her leadership role, Cheney was the No. 3 House Republican and the highest-ranking of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection on January 6 when a violent pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. The other nine House Republicans have also faced a backlash, including the threat of primary challenges over their impeachment votes as well as censure and calls for their resignation by state and local Republican groups.\n\nSome of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach, most notably Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, have continued to speak out about the \"Big Lie\" and the future of the Republican Party now that Trump is no longer in office. Others have taken a much lower profile approach since the impeachment vote, not frequently commenting publicly, if at all, on the direction the party is taking in the aftermath of the Trump presidency.\n\nHere's a (non-exhaustive) look at what has happened to the nine other House Republicans since they voted to impeach and the extent to which they have continued to speak out about the deep divisions within the party in the aftermath of January 6:\n\nAdam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nAdam Kinzinger has been in the national spotlight often since his impeachment vote as a leading critic of the Republican Party's embrace of Trump's \"Big Lie\" and other conspiracy theories. Kinzinger has spoken out in support of Cheney and criticized the GOP over the push to remove her from leadership.\n\n\"You cannot unite with lies, if somebody is going to use lies to gain power and say, 'let's have unity,' you can't do it,\" Kinzinger said at an event earlier this week. \"'We need to remove Liz Cheney because she makes me have to answer questions that I know are false.' That's what they're saying.\"\n\nKinzinger said at the event that House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Whip Steve Scalise \"decided that winning the next election was more important than a clear-eyed recognition of what happened on January 6.\"\n\n\"That was a lie that led to violence,\" he said.\n\nThe Illinois Republican recently launched a political action committee as part of an effort he's calling \"Country First\" that seeks to counter the GOP's embrace of conspiracy theories and the former President. The congressman has endorsed the nine other House Republicans who voted to impeach over the Capitol attack as they now face down the potential threat of primary challenges.\n\nHe also recently endorsed a Texas GOP congressional candidate, Michael Wood, who ran unsuccessfully in a crowded field on a platform calling for Republicans to turn away from Trump and reject conspiracy theories.\n\n\"I think what's important is that people see there are people out there that support you, that will back you if you do the right thing,\" Kinzinger told CNN of the endorsement. \"It's a long-term battle for the soul of the party.\"\n\nKinzinger has been censured by several county GOP organizations in Illinois and drawn a pro-Trump primary challenger, Catalina Lauf, who has said she is running against him, arguing that he \"betrayed his constituents\" and criticizing his impeachment vote.\n\nJohn Katko of New York\n\nJohn Katko has faced criticism from local GOP leaders in his home state of New York as a result of his impeachment vote.\n\nIn the run-up to the vote to oust Cheney, Katko said that if there was a vacancy for the leadership post of House GOP conference chair he would support GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, another New York lawmaker who now appears poised to be elevated to the position.\n\n\"I have every confidence that Elise will be a superb leader for all of our conference, not just some,\" Katko told The Auburn Citizen, though he also called Cheney \"a good friend.\"\n\nThe congressman has stood by his impeachment vote, telling CNN in February, \"Hell no,\" when asked if he had any regrets over the vote to impeach Trump.\n\nFred Upton of Michigan\n\nFred Upton has also faced rebukes from Republicans at the state level following his impeachment vote.\n\nBack in his home state of Michigan, the Allegan County Republican Party censured Upton for his vote, saying that he betrayed his \"oath of office and core values\" of the county party.\n\nThe Cass County Republican Party also censured the congressman over the impeachment vote."}

But there's no such thing as a routine impeachment.\n\nThe one President Donald Trump faces now, after inciting a riotous mob to attack the Capitol, is unprecedented in all sorts of ways, which means the process will feel entirely new and different from the one we saw in late 2019 around the Ukraine investigation.\n\nSpecifically, this House impeachment vote is likely to be done this week, and the Senate trial will occur after Trump leaves office.\n\nHere's another look at the impeachment process as it is spelled out in the Constitution and how it applies to this second impeachment of Trump, in which a US President is accused for the first time of inciting violence against another branch of government.\n\nWhat does the Constitution say about who can be impeached and for what reasons?\n\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. (Article 2, Section 4)\n\nWhat is Trump accused of doing?\n\nThere was a lot of debate during Trump's first impeachment and trial about whether the pressure he exerted on the President of Ukraine amounted to \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" or simply a set of policies.\n\nThis time, while there's an argument he committed treason, Democrats in the House have alleged Trump \"engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.\"\n\nThe Article argues that Trump incited his supporters by repeatedly denying the election results in the lead-up to the counting of the electoral votes, that he pressured Georgia's secretary of state to \"find\" additional votes for him, and in doing so he \"gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,\" \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.\"\n\nRead the entire thing here. It's short.\n\nWhat does the Constitution say about the House's role?\n\nThe House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. (Article 1, Section 2)\n\nWhat does that mean for Trump this time?\n\nGetting from Trump's misdeed to impeachment proceedings in the House took 86 days in 2019.\n\nIt's going to take just a week in 2021.\n\nThe House can essentially impeach at will. While there are precedents in place around instigating the impeachment process and utilizing House committees to investigate whether impeachable offenses occurred, none of that is necessarily required. And Democrats, moving quickly, aren't going to burden themselves by dragging this out.\n\nAnd why bother with an investigation when this time Trump did it on TV? In that first effort, the details of Trump's pressure on Ukraine leaked out over the course of weeks and built into Democratic support to launch and conduct an investigation and, ultimately, to impeach him.\n\nWith Trump's time in office set to expire at noon on January 20, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also gave Trump and Vice President Mike Pence the option of avoiding impeachment if either Trump resigned or Pence mobilized the Cabinet to use the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.\n\nWhen those two offramps were ignored, Democrats in the House moved quickly toward impeachment and the first post-presidential impeachment trial in US history.\n\nImpeaching Trump in the House requires only a simple majority and Democrats hope to gain at least some support from Republicans.\n\nWhat does the Constitution say about the Senate's role?"}

In February, the Republican-led Senate voted not to remove him from office. After that, impeachment mostly disappeared from national discourse, barely playing a role in the presidential election, even though it was a historic moment and the idea was stunningly popular, and even though it involved Trump's attempt to scuttle the campaign of Joe Biden, who ended up as the Democratic presidential nominee. But views on Trump were already largely ossified, and besides, there was the pandemic and an economic crisis to deal with.\n\nThe memory of impeachment is back with a vengeance this week. Though Biden beat Trump, the president continues to try to overturn Biden's victory. In a phone call on Saturday that was eerily reminiscent of Trump's July 2019 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump tried to pressure Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia (the state, not the country) to do something, anything, to throw the state's results back to him.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump won't just violate the rules again—he's already doing it\n\nDuring impeachment, Trump's critics, including me, warned repeatedly that if he were not impeached and removed, he'd feel empowered to commit the same offenses again. Trump's current, shambling coup attempt is the price of the Senate's failure to remove him.\n\nRaffensperger, who seems understandably furious over Trump's pressure campaign against him, taped the conversation and then released it to The Washington Post after Trump lied about it on Twitter. The president's MO has not changed since July 2019—in fact, it has scarcely changed over the course of his career. All the hallmarks of the Zelensky call popped up in the Saturday coup call. Trump alternates between wheedling flattery and domineering (though vague) threats. He suggests that Raffensperger owes him one—aren't they on the same team? He presents a proposed miscarriage of justice as a vindication of justice. Just as he did with Zelensky, Trump runs through a litany of wild and false conspiracy theories.\n\nTrump speaks like a mob boss, making his desire clear but never saying explicitly what he wants, so as to maintain deniability. What he says is, \"So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.\" What he means is, Find some way to throw out valid votes so that I can win. (Never mind that the state's results have been certified and its electors seated; Raffensperger's role has concluded.)"}

William Blount set a precedent for an impeachment trial after Trump leaves office\n\nWith so many constitutional questions swirling around the unusual situation of starting an impeachment trial after President Donald Trump leaves office, a look back in history — way back — shows precedent for just that.\n\nWith Trump impeached by the House, a new president assuming office and a Senate trial still to come, the name of Knoxville's William Blount has come back into the spotlight. He has the distinction of being a senator who was impeached and tried after being expelled from office, providing at least some historic clues about trying Trump after he leaves Washington.\n\nIt's not a perfect match, historians said. Trump was impeached for a second time while he was still in office and Blount was impeached after he had already been expelled by the Senate, but the timing has historic parallels.\n\nWilliam Blount's mess\n\nA native of North Carolina, Blount was an original signer of the U.S. Constitution and a Revolutionary War veteran. In 1790, President George Washington named him governor of the newly formed Tennessee Territory and he made his headquarters in Knoxville. When Tennessee joined the union in 1796, Blount was selected as one of the state's first two U.S. senators.\n\nThe fun ended soon after.\n\nThe next year, according to Senate records, Blount was in dire financial straits and he devised a plan using native people and frontiersmen to attack Spanish Florida and Louisiana in order to transfer those territories to Great Britain. The plan – and a handwritten letter detailing it – ended up in the hands of President John Adams who asked the legislature to handle it. It became the Senate's first impeachment case.\n\nSo, what does this early impeachment say about Trump's current situation? Legal experts and historians point to two things. One, again, it allows for an officeholder to be tried once they leave. More relevantly, it shows an impeachment doesn't mean the end of an official's political career.\n\nTried after being expelled\n\nMembers of the House informed the Senate – and a special committee looking into Blount – that they planned to impeach the Tennessean. Soon after, the Senate voted 25-1 to remove him.\n\nThe House went on to impeach but Blount was never convicted. His case was rejected in the Senate on jurisdictional grounds, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said. And this kind of trial of a former legislator would be considered inappropriate today, he said.\n\nHistory spotlight: Fingerprints shine a light on the slaves who built Blount Mansion — and Tennessee\n\nBlount didn't even show up for the trial, having already made it back to Tennessee where there was no pressure for him to return. When the Senate sent someone to get him to bring him back to the Capitol (then in Philadelphia), he refused.\n\nLincoln Memorial University constitutional law professor and Blount Mansion board member Stewart Harris said Blount shows that an impeachment trial timeline doesn't matter. The Senate can do what the Senate wants to do, he said.\n\nBut, he added, the Senate might not want to drag its feet before beginning any sort of trial.\n\n\"I think in terms of politics it might be better for the Senate to do it rather expeditiously and get it over with while the memories of the insurrection at the Capitol are fresh and while Trump's term has just recently concluded,\" he said. \"People might consider (holding an impeachment trial) more acceptable to do it at that point.\n\n\"If they wait a year, the politics might shift,\" he continued. \"But constitutionally speaking, they can do whatever they want to.\"\n\nPolitical future after impeachment\n\nSome of the supporters of Trump's impeachment have reasoned that convicting him and then immediately turning to disqualify him from future federal office would create a situation where he doesn't return. Impeachment requires support of two-thirds of the Senate, that is 67 votes, while banning him would only take a majority.\n\nBlount's case is no help with this theory. He was tried after being removed from office, but he was never convicted."}

The statement was one of two options they voted on; the other included a formal censure of Toomey.\n\nThe Inquirer obtained copies of the two competing statements Republicans voted on and the final tally, though they were not made public or released as of late Tuesday afternoon. The state GOP's Twitter account has been dormant since Feb. 13, when it posted a statement from chairman Lawrence Tabas expressing \"disappointment\" in Toomey's impeachment vote.\n\nToomey's office declined to comment on the vote to rebuke the senator.\n\n\"Democrats used impeachment as a political weapon, which set a dangerous precedent in America, and Senator Toomey did not stand in their way,\" the winning GOP statement said. \"We oppose the Senator's actions in the strongest terms, but we have faith that the voters will properly address public officials who do not satisfactorily represent the best interests of this nation.\"\n\nThe statement instead went on to take the unusual step of censuring four Pennsylvania Democrats: Gov. Tom Wolf, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, former Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, and former Health Secretary Rachel Levine, criticizing their handling of the 2020 election, the response to the coronavirus, and other matters.\n\n\"This body has concluded that censure action should be reserved for those who work every day to destroy the most exceptional nation in the world,\" the Republican statement said in targeting the Democrats.\n\nWhile the censures and admonitions are symbolic, especially since Toomey isn't seeking reelection, it was especially unusual for the GOP to censure Democrats, who would have no reason to expect support from the Republican political apparatus.\n\nPennsylvania Democrats saw the Republican message as an opening.\n\n\"With tonight's vote to rebuke Senator Toomey, Pennsylvania Republicans have sent a loud and clear message: they are the party of Donald Trump, QAnon, anti-American extremists and the Big Lie — and dissent will never be tolerated,\" state Democratic Party chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said in a statement. \"If you are turned off by the chaos and extremism of the GOP, we invite you to join our fight for a better Pennsylvania.\"\n\nInside the Pennsylvania Republican Party, the vote against Toomey, a staunch fiscal conservative who voted with Trump about 85% of the time, sent a signal about the GOP's outlook as it faces Trump's defeat and competitive races for governor and Senate in 2022.\n\nThe vote was 128-124 in favor of a statement that did not censure Toomey, with 13 abstentions. Party members had to choose between one statement that censured Toomey and one that admonished him. Both versions included a censure of Democrats. There was no option for voting against criticizing Toomey.\n\nSome Republicans were furious that the party didn't go as far in punishing Toomey as state parties did in North Carolina and Louisiana, where GOP senators also voted to convict."}

(AP) — Trashed on social media and censured by Louisiana Republicans, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy described himself Wednesday as \"at peace\" with his vote to convict former President Donald Trump at his impeachment trial and dismissed the scorching GOP backlash he's received.\n\nLouisiana's senior Republican senator said he does not believe the criticism represents the feelings of many of his party's voters. He said the censure he received from the leadership of the state Republican Party represented \"a small group of people,\" not the \"broader Republican Party.\"\n\n\"I am such at peace with that vote. I say that knowing that I'm getting criticized, but I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution,\" Cassidy said in a conference call with reporters on a variety of topics.\n\nCassidy joined six other Senate Republicans in voting with Democrats on Feb. 13 to convict Trump of inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in an impeachment trial that saw the former president acquitted. Louisiana's other U.S. senator, Republican John Kennedy, voted against conviction.\n\n\"I've received comments from folks who are Republican who object to the vote,\" Cassidy said. \"I've received a heck of a lot of folks who agree with me or, if they don't agree with me, respect the kind of thought process that went into it.\"\n\nHe added: \"There's a diversity of opinion among Louisiana Republicans, even if there is not among a very small group of people.\"\n\nThough the 57-43 Senate vote was short of the two-thirds majority needed to find Trump guilty, the seven GOP votes against Trump represented the largest number of lawmakers to ever vote to find a president of their own party guilty at impeachment proceedings.\n\nSome Republicans who voted to acquit Trump said they did not believe the Democrats proved their case that the former president was directly responsible for inciting hundreds of people to storm the Capitol building in a riot that left five people dead. Other Republicans said they simply did not believe Congress had jurisdiction over a president no longer in office.\n\nCassidy has tried to change the conversation since the impeachment trial ended, sending out daily statements about a variety of subjects and talking about other issues, such as the confirmation hearings of President Joe Biden's cabinet appointments and recovery from the icy weather.\n\nBut Trump supporters don't want to move on, and they've been slamming Cassidy on conservative talk radio and websites. They've called for Republicans to ban Cassidy from their events, and several local Republican groups have joined the executive committee of the state GOP in condemning Cassidy's vote to convict Trump."}

He's consistently worked against [Trump] as a Republican against a Republican president. It doesn't get any worse than that,\" said Chris Mathys, the only Republican challenger in California's pro-Biden 21st Congressional District.\n\nEleven of the 17 Republicans who supported Trump's second impeachment -- the 10 representatives and one senator -- face voters again in 2022, and 10 of them are facing challengers from within their own party.\n\n\"This impeachment vote, to me, was simply the last straw in what has been a political career full of choices abandoning his duty to protect our Constitution and the people's individual liberties,\" said Jonah Schulz, who is challenging Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez despite Trump throwing his weight behind a different candidate.\n\nCandidates don't file to get on the ballot with their state's department overseeing elections until an election year, but across the 11 races, 40 Republicans have filed candidacies with the Federal Election Commission, a requirement to raise and spend campaign cash.\n\nTo put that figure into perspective, in 2020, eight of the 10 Republicans ran as incumbents. Across those eight districts, only four non-incumbent Republicans were on the primary ballots.\n\nWhile not all of these campaigns will materialize -- some candidates don't even have a website or have raised little to no money -- several candidates are waging serious campaigns, and the kingmaker, Trump, has been sparing with his endorsements so far.\n\nIncumbents rarely lose primaries. In the post-World War II era, 98% of House members who sought reelection won their party's nomination, according to an analysis by Sabato's Crystal Ball. But Trump is a chronic disrupter of norms, and when it comes to the Republicans who defied him, he wants to \"get rid of them all,\" as he said at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nIf he makes his preferred candidate known, these primary races will test how firm the former president's grip still is on the GOP.\n\n\"When the former president, who is the most popular person in the Republican Party, is ... getting involved in some of these challenger races, that's not generally the case when you see challengers to incumbents,\" said Taylor Budowich, a senior adviser to Ohio congressional candidate Max Miller.\n\nMiller is one of two challengers Trump has already endorsed, and the former president is holding a rally outside Cleveland Saturday night to support him. A former White House staffer and veteran of the former president's campaigns, Miller is running against Gonzalez in Ohio's 16th Congressional District. Trump's endorsement -- received on the day he announced his campaign -- is prominently displayed on Miller's website.\n\nOf all the pro-impeachment Republicans, South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice is by far facing the most primary challengers -- 11 total. Voters in South Carolina's 7th Congressional District backed Trump over Biden by nearly 19 points, the second-largest margin among the pro-impeachment Republicans' districts."}

(AP) — Before he became the object of fury of Republicans for voting to convict Donald Trump during the former president's second impeachment trial, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was once the insurgent from the right.\n\nIt is now Toomey facing angry rank-and-file state Republican Party committee members and the potential of a censure vote, a symbolic gesture that may have no real effect on the senator since he isn't seeking reelection next year.\n\nToomey, who once endorsed challenges to Republican officeholders who weren't seen as conservative enough, is now urging Republicans to be tolerant of a difference of opinion over whether Trump and his long campaign of falsehoods to discredit the election result is to blame for the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I understand that most Republicans probably disagree with the conclusion that I came to,\" Toomey said during a Thursday radio appearance on WPHT-AM in Philadelphia. \"I don't think it's a good idea for the party to be deciding that they're going to censure a particular elected Republican over a particular vote, and I think it sends a bad message to the many Republicans, even if they're in the minority, the many Republicans who do agree with what I've done here.\"\n\nToomey last Saturday became one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump of \"incitement of insurrection,\" even though the vote to convict ultimately fell 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority, or 67, necessary in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe state GOP chair, Lawrence Tabas, promptly emailed state party committee members to tell them he was planning a meeting to discuss the Senate's action.\n\nThat meeting — if it happens — is expected to involve a censure resolution, as a wave of county parties have already voted to censure Toomey."}

Liz Cheney as their No. 3 leader and saying they'd fight a Democratic push to kick Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off her committees.\n\nCongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has shown support on social media for calls to violence against Democrats and a range of conspiracy theories. Her Twitter account was suspended in January after she repeated allegations of fraud in the US presidential election\n\nIn a 145-61 vote by secret ballot, House Republicans overwhelmingly rebuffed a rebellion by hard-right conservatives to toss Cheney, R-Wyo., over her vote last month to impeach then-President Donald Trump.\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy ridiculed Democrats for slating a House vote on Thursday that would remove Greene from her committees. McCarthy's comment was a signal that he was dismissing bipartisan demands that the hard-right Georgia Republican be punished for her online embrace of racist and violent views and bizarre conspiracy theories.\n\nThe decisions over Greene and Cheney have subjected the GOP to a politically agonizing test of its direction as it moves beyond the Trump presidency. Since he grudgingly vacated the White House last month, the party has been ideologically adrift as it's struggled over whether to embrace his norm-busting divisiveness or the party's more traditional, policy-oriented conservative values.\n\nBut shortly after the Democratic-led House Rules Committee cleared the way for Thursday's vote, McCarthy released a statement saying Democrats were \"choosing to raise the temperature\" by attempting a \"partisan power grab.\"\n\nMcCarthy condemned Greene's past endorsements of conspiracy theories — after weeks of saying little critical of her — and said the first-term congresswoman had recognized in a private conversation that she must meet \"a higher standard\" as a lawmaker. Greene has shown support for calls to violence against Democrats and bizarre fictions about faked school shootings.\n\n\"I hold her to her word, as well as her actions going forward,\" McCarthy said.\n\n00:30\n\nCheney is a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a fixture of the party establishment. She was among just 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump last month.\n\n\"I won't apologize for the vote,\" Cheney told her colleagues in the closed-door session, according to a person familiar with the session who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\n\nDuring a break in that closed-door session, McCarthy told reporters he'd defended Cheney inside.\n\n\"People can have differences of opinion. That's what you can have a discussion about. Liz has a right to vote her conscience,\" said McCarthy, who'd previously given no clear signal about whether he'd support his lieutenant.\n\nAt the earlier Rules Committee meeting, Chair Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said lawmakers would send \"an awful message\" if they took no action on Greene. \"If this is not the bottom, I don't know what the hell is,\" McGovern said.\n\nMcCarthy tried to push blame onto Democrats, criticizing them for taking no action against their own lawmakers whom he didn't name, including one he said \"spread anti-Semitic tropes.\" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., made comments critical of Israel in 2019 and apologized.\n\nThe internal GOP fight over how to handle Greene and Cheney underscored the hold Trump and his voters still have on much of the party. But it's not uniform.\n\nAround two-thirds of House Republicans voted to back Trump's effort to overturn his November election loss — just hours after his supporters' deadly storming of the Capitol that led to his impeachment for inciting insurrection. Yet Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP senators have lambasted Greene, reflecting worries that her wing of the party cannot win statewide Senate races.\n\nHouse Republicans had faced bipartisan pressure to punish Greene, including from McConnell. A House vote was expected to be a political ordeal for many Republicans, forcing them to go on record defending or punishing the unapologetic, social media-savvy Greene.\n\nShe burst onto the national political scene after just a month in office and with enthusiastic support from Trump. Even during the effort to punish her, she has lashed out at Democrats and raised money on the controversy.\n\nRepublicans appointed Greene to the Education and Labor Committee, a decision that drew especially harsh criticism because of her suggestions that mass school shootings in Connecticut and Florida could be hoaxes. Greene is also on the Budget Committee.\n\nMcCarthy said Democrats turned down his offer to move Greene onto the House Small Business Committee instead."}

Eric Swalwell, who served as a House manager in Donald Trump's last impeachment trial, filed a lawsuit Friday against the former president, his son, lawyer and a Republican congressman whose actions he charges led to January's insurrection.\n\nThe California Democrat's suit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleges a conspiracy to violate civil rights, along with negligence, inciting a riot and inflicting emotional distress. It follows a similar suit filed by Rep. Bennie Thompson last month in an attempt to hold the former president accountable in some way for his actions Jan. 6, following his Senate acquittal.\n\nSwalwell charges that Trump, his son Donald Jr., along with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, had made \"false and incendiary allegations of fraud and theft, and in direct response to the Defendant's express calls for violence at the rally, a violent mob attacked the U.S. Capitol.\"\n\nThe lawsuit spells out in detail how the Trumps, Giuliani and Brooks spread baseless claims of election fraud, both before and after the 2020 presidential election was declared, and charges that they helped to spin up the thousands of rioters before they stormed the Capitol. Five people died as a result of the violence on Jan. 6, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer.\n\nTrump's spokesman Jason Miller called Swalwell a \"low-life\" with \"no credibility.\"\n\n\"Now, after failing miserably with two impeachment hoaxes,\" Swalwell is attacking \"our greatest President with yet another witch hunt,\" Miller said in a statement. \"It's a disgrace that a compromised Member of Congress like Swalwell still sits on the House Intelligence Committee.\"\n\nBrooks said the lawsuit was frivolous and \"a meritless ploy.\"\n\n\"I make no apologies whatsoever for fighting for accurate and honest elections,\" he said, adding he wore the lawsuit \"like a badge of courage.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, through Trump's own words, accuses the former president of inciting the riot, using much of the same playbook used by Swalwell and others during Trump's impeachment trial — that his lies over the election results stirred supporters into the false belief the 2020 election had been stolen, that he egged the angry mob on through his rally speech and that he did nothing when faced with the images of throngs of his supporters smashing windows at the U.S. Capitol and sending lawmakers fleeing.\n\n\"Those with knowledge claimed that during this moment of national horror, Trump was 'delighted' and was 'confused about why other people on his team weren't as excited as he was.' Others described Trump as 'borderline enthusiastic' about the unfolding violence,\" according to the suit.\n\nUnlike Thompson's lawsuit — filed against Trump, Giuliani and some far-right extremist groups whose members are alleged to have participated in the insurrection — Swalwell's did not specify whether he was filing in his personal or official capacity, which would require additional approvals from the House and involve House attorneys.\n\nBoth lawsuits cite a federal civil rights law that was enacted to counter the Ku Klux Klan's intimidation of officials. Swalwell's attorney Philip Andonian praised Thompson's lawsuit, filed under a Reconstruction-era law called the Ku Klux Klan Act, and said they were behind it 100%, but saw the need for this one, too.\n\n\"We see ourselves as having a different angle to this, holding Trump accountable for the incitement, the disinformation,\" he said.\n\nPresidents are historically afforded broad immunity from lawsuits for actions they take in their role as commander in chief. But the lawsuit, like the one by Thompson, was brought against Trump in his personal, not official, capacity.\n\nSwalwell also describes in detail being trapped in the House chamber with many other members of Congress as plainclothes Capitol Police officers barricaded the doors and tried to fend off the mob at gunpoint.\n\n\"Fearing for their lives, the Plaintiff and others masked their identities as members of Congress, texted loved ones in case the worst happened, and took shelter throughout the Capitol complex,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Brooks \"conspired with the other Defendants to undermine the election results by alleging, without evidence, that the election had been rigged and by pressuring elected officials, courts, and ultimately Congress to reject the results.\" It notes that he spoke at a rally supporting Trump at the Ellipse, near the White House, shortly before thousands of pro-Trump rioters made their way to the Capitol and overwhelmed police officers to shove their way inside the building.\n\nThe suit seeks unspecified damages, and Swalwell also wants a court to order all of the defendants to provide written notice to him a week before they plan to have a rally in Washington that would draw more than 50 people."}

But the House is poised to return this week as lawmakers itch to respond to Trump, who encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol as Vice President Pence and lawmakers were formally tallying Biden's Electoral College win.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) laid out the path forward for Democrats in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter on Sunday night.\n\n\"In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,\" Pelosi wrote. \"As the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.\"\n\nPelosi, who was personally targeted by some members of the pro-Trump mob in Wednesday's insurrection, said Democrats will try to adopt Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin's 25th Amendment resolution on Monday by unanimous consent — a gambit sure to be blocked by Trump's conservative allies.\n\nIf that fails, Democrats will bring it to the floor on Tuesday as they try to push for Pence, who was also a target for the rioters, to respond within 24 hours. Democrats, and some Republicans, are supportive of Pence invoking the 25th Amendment, which would allow the VP and a majority of the Cabinet to sideline Trump.\n\nPelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) called Pence to discuss the issue late last week, where Schumer said they were put on hold for more than 20 minutes. They ultimately didn't connect with Pence.\n\nPelosi didn't say in her letter when the House would vote on impeaching Trump, but aides are expecting a vote as soon as Wednesday, likely on a single article. Language drafted by Reps. Raskin, David Cicilline (R.I.) and Ted Lieu (Calif.) charges Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors for \"willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States.\"\n\nTrump would be the first president to be impeached more than once.\n\nAs of late Sunday afternoon Cicilline said he had 210 co-sponsors.\n\nIf the House votes to impeach Trump — which would mark the second time of his presidency — when Democrats would send the articles to the Senate is unclear, and could have implications for how quickly Congress can act on Biden's agenda.\n\nOutgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned in a memo to lawmakers over the weekend that an impeachment trial is unlikely to start before Biden is sworn in, meaning a trial could bog down the ability to confirm Biden's Cabinet and take up other early legislation.\n\nBiden hasn't weighed in on the impeachment talk publicly, saying that it was a decision for Congress.\n\n\"What the Congress decides to do is for them to decide, but I'm going to have to — and they're going to have to be ready to hit the ground running,\" Biden said. \"Because when [Vice President-elect Kamala Harris] and I are sworn in we're going to be introducing immediately significant pieces of legislation to deal with the virus, to deal with the economy and deal with economic growth.\"\n\nHe added that the quickest way to get Trump out of office was for him to be sworn in on Jan. 20.\n\nDemocrats will control the Senate after the 20th but they would still need significant support from Republicans to vote to convict Trump. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) has said he is open to articles of impeachment from the House."}

These critics maintain that our commitment to the First Amendment should solely trigger a defense of the president's \"free speech.\" But freedom of speech poses no bar to holding a president responsible for his unfounded, bad-faith effort to subvert the results of a free and fair election.\n\nOur board — comprised of leading lawyers and activists from every state and the District of Columbia — is a thoughtful, deliberative body of committed civil libertarians. After meetings on both Saturday and Sunday, the ACLU board unanimously passed a resolution again calling for President Trump's impeachment, which can be found here.\n\nWe discussed at length the free speech implications of this impeachment process. We concluded that President Trump's remarks on Jan. 6 can be considered part of a pattern of efforts to upend an election he lost. If a president's repeated lies, illegal political pressure, and the stoking of a mob to subvert the democratic process are not an abuse of power warranting impeachment, it is difficult to know what would be.\n\nHolding the president accountable for his words on Jan. 6, as part of that pattern, does not run afoul of the First Amendment. The House impeachment resolution reflects this. It does not single out Trump's speech on Jan. 6 inciting a mob, but rather identifies it as part of a pattern of \"efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification results of the 2020 presidential election,\" including the improper pressure placed on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger \"to 'find' enough votes to overturn the Georgia presidential election results and threatened Mr. Raffensperger if he failed to do so.\"\n\nThe ACLU believes a president can be impeached for speech that a private citizen could not be prosecuted for.\n\nFirst, proceedings to impeach and remove a president are not criminal proceedings. They specifically seek to remove the president from office. While the First Amendment would likely bar the criminal conviction of a private citizen for the president's Jan. 6 speech, impeachment is a political remedy: to remove an executive official who has abused his office, not to convict them of a criminal offense. The Supreme Court has long held that public employees can be fired for on-the-job speech that would be fully protected from criminal prosecution. Whether the president has any First Amendment rights when speaking in his capacity as president has never been established. At a minimum, because of his role and authority, the president does not have the same freedom of speech as an ordinary citizen.\n\nThe First Amendment doesn't protect the rights of public employees to say whatever they want when speaking in their official capacity. As a matter of law, public employees are regularly sanctioned for speech that fosters a hostile work environment. Their public position imbues their speech with more influence than the average citizen — as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. It follows that President Trump doesn't have unfettered free speech rights to subvert the results of a fair and free election. In short, a president who recklessly urged his followers to violate the law could be impeached even if an ordinary citizen could not be convicted for the same words, absent proof that his speech was intended and likely to produce imminent lawless action."}

(WLBT) - In the past three months, the country has seen an election, an attempted insurrection at the United States Capitol, an inauguration and an impeachment.\n\nFor many congressmen and women, the last three months have also been the most consequential of their political lives, first on their vote to certify the election results and then choosing whether to vote to impeach Donald Trump for a second time.\n\nRepublican Representative Michael Guest of Mississippi's District 3 has faced both criticism and praise for his decisions in the past month. We sat down with the congressman through Zoom to ask him about those decisions, how he came to them and his thoughts on the the current controversy surrounding Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for both length and clarity\n\nMG: \"I think as we look over the last three months, we see that that was a period unlike any time in modern United States history. We saw a very contested presidential race, a race that was not decided on Election Night--a race that was not decided for days, almost weeks later. And there was a great deal of animosity on both sides during that race. Because of some issues with the presidential election, we saw election contests filed in court, state courts, federal courts. We saw challenges to the certification of the election in Washington, D.C. We saw on the day, of course, as everyone recalls, the riots that occurred here in Washington, D.C. We saw actually the business of the American people interrupted as protesters entered into the House chambers and then we saw a second impeachment of President Donald Trump. There have been many challenges that we have faced over the last three months, over the last year. We have also seen some events that we will never see again in our lifetime.\"\n\nMG: \"I thought that there were voter irregularities, that there was probably voter fraud. Being a former prosecutor, I have prosecuted cases of voter fraud. But we were never presented evidence to show that the voter irregularity, the voter fraud was substantial enough that the elections should be overturned. I think everyone, Republicans and Democrats, if you were to ask them, probably would tell you that there was voter fraud, that there was voter irregularity. I think that we may disagree on the scale or the scope of that, but there was never evidence presented by the President, by the administration, by his campaign team that showed me that there was enough voter fraud that the election should be overturned. Now I did vote to challenge two of the states that were brought up and I did not vote to challenge those states based on election fraud or election irregularity. I believe that the will of the legislature was violated by the court system and, in Pennsylvania, by the Secretary of State. I felt like the will of the people in those states, that should have followed their legislative laws set forth by each state, were not followed and so those were the rationales that I took in voting against certifying both of those states. Not the fact that I thought there was widespread voter fraud or widespread voter misconduct in either Arizona or Pennsylvania.\""}

Lawyer Albert Watkins said it's important for senators to hear the voice of someone who was incited by Mr. Trump.\n\nWatkins said his client was previously \"horrendously smitten\" by Mr. Trump but now feels let down after Mr. Trump's refusal to grant Chansley and others who participated in the insurrection a pardon. \"He felt like he was betrayed by the president,\" Watkins said.\n\nWatkins said he hasn't spoken to any member in the Senate since announcing his offer to have Chansley — also known as Jake Angeli — testify at the trial, which is scheduled to begin the week of February 8.\n\nThe words of Trump supporters who are accused of participating in the riot may end up being used against him in his impeachment trial. Chansley and at least four others people who are facing federal charges stemming from the riot have suggested they were taking orders from the now-former president.\n\nChansley, who calls himself the \"QAnon Shaman\" and has long been a fixture at Trump rallies, hasn't yet entered a plea to charges of civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, disorderly conduct in a restricted building, demonstrating in a Capitol building and other counts. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Washington.\n\nIn successfully seeking his detention until trial, prosecutors said Chansley went into the Capitol carrying a U.S. flag attached to a wooden pole topped with a spear and ignored an officer's commands to leave. Prosecutors said Chansley entered the Senate chamber with a group of about 25 rioters, posed for pictures at the dais where then-Vice President Mike Pence had been minutes before, and left a note that read, \"It's only a matter of time. Justice is coming.\"\n\nThe following day, prosecutors say Chansley called the FBI Washington field office, admitted his involvement and described Pence as a \"child-trafficking traitor,\" but said he did not intend the note to be a threat. When asked about the meaning of the note, he launched into a \"lengthy diatribe\" describing current and past lawmakers including Pence, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden as \"infiltrators involved in various types of wrongdoing.\"\n\nChansley told investigators he came to the Capitol \"at the request of the president that all 'patriots' come to D.C. on January 6,\" according to court records."}

Every day.\"\n\nAnother person familiar with her daily routine confirms Trump's affinity for the private club's spa facilities, noting it is not unusual for her to spend several hours a day there, enjoying the benefits at her disposal, often going twice in a 24-hour period, for massages, nail care, facial treatments or other items on the menu.\n\n\"She almost always does dinner,\" said a third person who has seen Trump outside of the spa. She spends her evenings on the outdoor patio of Mar-a-Lago, where she prefers fish for an entrée, according to the source, and is often joined at the table by her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, who reside in a private suite of rooms at Mar-a-Lago for much of the year.\n\nThough she is now a former first lady of the United States, her daily routine has not seen a significant change.\n\n\"It's pretty much the same as it was before (she was first lady) or even when she would come down during vacations,\" said the source familiar with Trump's schedule, noting there is not much evidence to delineate pre- and post-White House activities or work.\n\nMelania Trump's office did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\nTrump is in the midst of setting up an official office and has hired three former employees from her East Wing staff in the hopes of resurrecting her Be Best campaign of helping children, continuing her \"work,\" as she calls it to friends.\n\nMoments of bitterness\n\nYet there have been moments of bitterness and regret, say several people with knowledge of Trump's conversations of late, most notably since Joe Biden's inauguration and with respect to the activities of her successor, Jill Biden.\n\nWhen Trump left Washington, she had the worst favorability ratings of any modern first lady upon departure from the White House, according to polling conducted by SSRS for CNN.\n\nAt one time, early in her tenure, that wasn't the case – Melania Trump was the most-liked member of the Trump family and the broader administration. But it's possible that Donald Trump's incendiary style, even though not necessarily something his wife condoned, had the residual effect of chipping away at the first lady's popularity. After the January 6 attack on the Capitol, Melania Trump did not make a statement denouncing the violence for five days.\n\n\"She could see how it was going to go for her,\" said one former White House official who spoke to CNN, noting that Trump felt she was in a lose-lose predicament whether she spoke publicly or not. If she condemned the violence, her husband and his base would be angered and it would create a stir about her breaking with the President. And by staying silent, she was implying support for what happened.\n\n\"Once (the insurrection) happened, she knew there was nothing to gain for her by speaking out or doing something – so she didn't do anything,\" the former White House official said.\n\nTwo members of the first lady's staff resigned shortly after the deadly insurrection in protest of the administration's seeming acquiescence.\n\nTrump, according to a person familiar with her schedule, had planned on going to Biden's inauguration and learned she would not be attending when her husband tweeted he would not go."}

Richard Burr (N.C.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Mitt Romney (Utah), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.). Only once before had even one member of a president's party voted to convict: Romney voted to convict in Trump's previous impeachment trial.\n\nNotably, the number of GOP votes for conviction was larger than the previous number in support of proceeding with the trial. In total, 17 Republicans voted either to impeach Trump or convict him during these proceedings — with both the 10 House impeachment votes and the seven conviction votes being unprecedented.\n\nBut Cassidy's vote might be the most significant. Burr and Toomey are retiring, and the others have been high-profile critics of Trump. Cassidy comes from one of the most conservative states in the country. Even his vote to proceed with the trial last week — after he previously voted that the trial was unconstitutional — led to predictions that he would eventually fall in line. As with several other Republicans, he risked a great deal to vote as he did.\n\nOne key vote the House impeachment managers did not get was that of another senator who had expressed openness to conviction: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell suggested in a speech after the vote that he indeed blamed Trump, saying, \"President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.\" But he said Trump's status as former president rendered the issues at hand moot.\n\nGiven the historically bipartisan votes, though, you have to wonder whether, had McConnell decided to press the issue, he could have assembled enough votes for a conviction.\n\nIt probably never would have happened, but it was closer than most predicted.\n\n2. The Democrats' back-down\n\nAs the trial began on Tuesday, a disconnect emerged. Democrats said this situation was vitally important — so important that they needed to impeach Trump for the second time and then, for the first time in history, hold a Senate trial for a former president — yet they didn't plan to call any witnesses to unearth new evidence.\n\nFor a brief period Saturday, given that several huge questions remained unresolved, it appeared they were reversing course. They called for a subpoena of Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) to describe Trump's phone call with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) during the Capitol riot.\n\nThen they backed off. A deal was cut under which Beutler's statement suggesting Trump had spoken approvingly of the Capitol rioters in real time would be entered into the trial record, and no witnesses would be called.\n\nIt's easy to call this a cave. As many noted, Democrats seemed to have the votes for witnesses, with several Republicans voting with them on the broader question of whether to allow witnesses. Enough Republicans appeared to be on board and conviction-curious to hear from the likes of Herrera Beutler and others. Trump's lawyers could have requested all the witnesses they wanted — and they threatened to call hundreds — but each would have required a vote. Democrats held the cards.\n\nAnd then they laid down their hand."}

Trump\n\nThe biography for President Trump and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association.\n\nDonald John Trump was born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946. His father, Fred Trump was a successful real estate developer. Trump was educated at the New York Military Academy and the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1971, he took over his father's real estate company, renaming it the Trump Organization. The business soon became involved in variety of projects, including hotels, resorts, residential and commercial building, casinos, and golf courses. His first of many books was The Art of the Deal, published in 1987. In 2004, he launched the reality television show The Apprentice.\n\nIn 2005, Donald Trump married Melania Knauss. They have one son, Barron. Trump also has four adult children from previous marriages: Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany.\n\nDuring the 2016 primary, Trump defeated more than a dozen rivals to win the Republican nomination. While he lost the popular vote, Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the general election by winning a majority of Electoral College votes. His campaign slogan was \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nWithout previous elected political experience, President Trump used unconventional methods to communicate his priorities. Most notably, he used the social media platform Twitter as a primary mechanism for direct communication with the American public, other politicians, and the press corps.\n\nAs president, he signed a major tax reform bill into law and oversaw a reduction of federal regulations. His protectionist trade policies included tariffs in foreign aluminum, steel, and other products. The Trump administration also renegotiated trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea. Other domestic priorities included Supreme Court and federal judiciary appointments, increased military budgets, aggressive border and immigration control, criminal justice reform, and the reduction of prescription drug prices.\n\nIn foreign policy, the Trump administration moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and brokered normalization agreements between Israel and a number of countries. In 2018, President Trump attended a summit with Kim Jong Un, marking the first time a sitting president met with a North Korean leader.\n\nIn 2018, there was a partial government shutdown as Trump disagreed with Congress over funding for a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The funding lapse lasted thirty-five days before it was resolved."}

His four-year tenure in the White House revealed extraordinary fissures in American society but left little doubt that he is a figure unlike any other in the nation's history.\n\nTrump, the New York businessman and former reality TV show star, won the 2016 election after a campaign that defied norms and commanded public attention from the moment it began. His approach to governing was equally unconventional.\n\nOther presidents tried to unify the nation after turning from the campaign trail to the White House. From his first days in Washington to his last, Trump seemed to revel in the political fight. He used his presidential megaphone to criticize a long list of perceived adversaries, from the news media to members of his own administration, elected officials in both political parties and foreign heads of state. The more than 26,000 tweets he sent as president provided an unvarnished, real-time account of his thinking on a broad spectrum of issues and eventually proved so provocative that Twitter permanently banned him from its platform. In his final days in office, Trump became the first president ever to be impeached twice – the second time for inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol during the certification of the election he lost – and the nation's first chief executive in more than 150 years to refuse to attend his successor's inauguration.\n\nTrump's policy record included major changes at home and abroad. He achieved a string of long-sought conservative victories domestically, including the biggest corporate tax cuts on record, the elimination of scores of environmental regulations and a reshaping of the federal judiciary. In the international arena, he imposed tough new immigration restrictions, withdrew from several multilateral agreements, forged closer ties with Israel and launched a tit-for-tat trade dispute with China as part of a wider effort to address what he saw as glaring imbalances in America's economic relationship with other countries.\n\nMany questions about Trump's legacy and his role in the nation's political future will take time to answer. But some takeaways from his presidency are already clear from Pew Research Center's studies in recent years. In this essay, we take a closer look at a few of the key societal shifts that accelerated – or emerged for the first time – during the tenure of the 45th president.\n\nHow we did this This examination of how the United States changed during Donald Trump's presidency is based on an analysis of public opinion survey data from Pew Research Center, administrative data from government agencies, news reports and other sources. Links to the original sources of data – including the field dates, sample sizes and methodologies of individual surveys by the Center – are included wherever possible. Unless otherwise noted, all references to Republicans and Democrats in this analysis include independents who lean to each party.\n\nDeeply partisan and personal divides\n\nTrump's status as a political outsider, his outspoken nature and his willingness to upend past customs and expectations of presidential behavior made him a constant focus of public attention, as well as a source of deep partisan divisions.\n\nEven before he took office, Trump divided Republicans and Democrats more than any incoming chief executive in the prior three decades. The gap only grew more pronounced after he became president. An average of 86% of Republicans approved of Trump's handling of the job over the course of his tenure, compared with an average of just 6% of Democrats – the widest partisan gap in approval for any president in the modern era of polling. Trump's overall approval rating never exceeded 50% and fell to a low of just 29% in his final weeks in office, shortly after a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats weren't just divided over Trump's handling of the job. They also interpreted many aspects of his character and personality in fundamentally opposite ways. In a 2019 survey, at least three-quarters of Republicans said the president's words sometimes or often made them feel hopeful, entertained, informed, happy and proud. Even larger shares of Democrats said his words sometimes or often made them feel concerned, exhausted, angry, insulted and confused."}

Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead impeachment manager, spoke by far the most words of anyone in the first seven days of the trial (nearly four times as many words as the second most prominent speaker), the impeachment managers have spread the speaking time a little more evenly this time.\n\nRep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), the lead impeachment manager for this trial, has spoken just over 26,000 words, while Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), and Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands) and Trump lawyers David Schoen and Bruce L. Castor Jr. have each spoken more than 10,000 words. Another Trump lawyer, Michael T. van der Veen, took a prominent role late in the trial, speaking 9,600 words.\n\nSchoen, the Trump lawyer who spoke the most, delivered an aggressive attack on the constitutionality of the trial during arguments Tuesday over the constitutionality of the trial, but added comparatively little to his total Friday, while Castor and van der Veen took the lead.\n\nTrump's defense team used only one-third of the time House managers took during opening arguments. The Senate ruled on the first day of the trial for up to 16 hours for each side. House managers relied more on video, testimonials and audio footage from Jan. 6 events and Trump's defense used video montages of Democrats and media coverage.\n\nBoth sides relied on video during trial's opening arguments\n\nSenators are commanded at the start of each day to remain silent \"on pain of imprisonment,\" which is why most said only a few words early on: mostly \"yes\" or \"no\" votes on the rules package for the trial and the constitutionality question the Senate considered Monday. On Day Four, some senators stepped forward to offer questions to each side.\n\nA few, though, spoke more often. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke 1,256 words; he makes a few procedural motions in the trial each day, including introducing the rules package Tuesday that governs how the trial works and calling for the chamber to recess at the end of the day.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who spoke up after the proceedings Wednesday to make an objection, has spoken 342 words. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who is presiding over the trial as Senate president pro tempore, has spoken more than 12,800 words. A few other officials — the acting Senate sergeant at arms, the chaplain and the clerk (who was asked to read the article of impeachment aloud) — have each spoken as well."}

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), among Trump's staunchest congressional defenders, said the fact that only 10 Republicans joined the Democrats showed the president's support remained strong.\n\nAsked whether Trump could remain an effective leader of the party, Jordan said, \"Of course, he is.\"\n\n\"His support is strong because the American people appreciated that over the past four years he did more of what he said he would do than any president in my lifetime,\" Jordan said.\n\nBut other House Republicans said the lopsided GOP vote reflected concerns about the impeachment process and should not be seen as an endorsement of Trump's behavior.\n\n\"It actually represents a feeling among Republicans — even Republicans who are disappointed with this president — that with only seven days left to go in his term and with the toxic political environment being what it is, that there's a real need in the country to lower the temperature,\" said Rep.

John Thune is criticizing Republican activists and party leaders for engaging in \"cancel culture\" by rushing to censure GOP senators who found former President Donald Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection.\n\nIn his first interview since he voted to acquit Trump, the Senate's No. 2 Republican on Thursday defended fellow Republicans who sided with Democrats on the \"vote of conscience\" and warned against shutting out dissenting voices in the party. He also discussed Republicans' priorities under President Joe Biden, the proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package and upcoming primary battles within his own party.\n\n\"There was a strong case made,\" Thune said of the Democrats' impeachment presentation last week. \"People could come to different conclusions. If we're going to criticize the media and the left for cancel culture, we can't be doing that ourselves.\"\n\nThune's remarks were his first explaining his vote in Trump's trial and assessing the turbulent GOP politics the former president has left behind. Thune, who faces reelection next year, is among several establishment Republicans grappling with how to reclaim control of a party dominated by Trump for years.\n\nThe senator rarely criticized Trump while he was in office, but he called the former president's post-election actions \"inexcusable\" and accused him of undermining the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nStill, Thune sided with most Republican senators and GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell in voting to acquit. Thune and others argued that Trump could not be impeached because he was already out of office. Democrats fell 10 votes short of the 67 need to convict.\n\nSince then, Trump has lashed out at McConnell and repeated the baseless claim that he won the election. The comments have inflamed a feud that is likely to play out in GOP primaries between Trump-backed candidates and those supported by the establishment wing.\n\nThune suggested he would be taking steps to assist candidates \"who don't go off and talk about conspiracies and that sort of thing.\" He praised Rep. Liz Cheney — a Wyoming Republican, who was censured by the Wyoming GOP for voting to impeach Trump — for doing an \"exceptional job on most issues,\" and said he was ready to jump into primary battles like the one she is sure to face.\n\n\"At the grassroots level, there's a lot of people who want to see Trump-like candidates,\" he said. \"But I think we're going to be looking for candidates that are electable.\"\n\nDespite the escalating fight over control of the GOP, Thune said he believes Republicans are well-positioned to take back the Senate, citing policy overreach by the Democrats."}

Need help navigating the Republican primaries? Get text updates from Karen Tumulty. ArrowRight The storming of the Capitol was one of the most deplorable and shocking events in U.S. history. Never before had a mob of Americans seized the citadel of American democracy in a fit of fury. The evidence produced at former president Donald Trump's impeachment trial that showed some intended to kill Vice President Mike Pence and Pelosi demonstrated how close the event came to being catastrophically worse. We must get to the bottom of what happened and why.\n\nPelosi's proposed commission could accomplish that. The 9/11 Commission that she says this would be modeled on was genuinely bipartisan. Its five Republican and five Democratic members were distinguished former legislators and public officials whose prestige and reputations lent credibility to the investigation. It conducted months of investigations, followed the evidence where it led and produced a massive report detailing what happened and offering recommendations to prevent a similar tragedy. No such effort is immune from criticism, but the 9/11 Commission did an excellent job of putting politics behind it in pursuit of the truth.\n\nThat's exactly what's needed here. We need to know how the riot came to be and why Capitol security failed so dismally. Given the prevailing partisan passions, such an effort must be perceived by all to be interested in the truth and not in digging up nuggets of facts that would then be spun into a partisan web.\n\nThis effort should look at the role Trump and his official or campaign staff played in organizing or inspiring the rally that transformed into the riot. It should also look into what Trump knew about the riot and when, and what he did and did not do to protect the vice president, lawmakers and their staffs. We don't know what this will uncover, but it could find things that will make many Republicans unhappy and uncomfortable.\n\nBut that's not the only line of inquiry it should pursue. Did anyone — including extremists on the right — infiltrate the protesters with the intent of turning a mass rally into a violent event? Some on the right still believe antifa or other leftist extremist were involved even though the FBI discredits that notion. These possibilities should also be thoroughly investigated regardless of who might be embarrassed or what it implies for Trump's culpability.\n\nThe commission should also examine why Capitol Police failed so dismally when put to the test. It's clear that at a minimum they were understaffed, improperly equipped and poorly deployed. It's also clear that supporting forces, such as the National Guard or D.C. police, were not readily available in case the gathering exploded out of control. History would have been very different if police had held their lines and kept protesters outside the building. It's crucial to understand why such a massive and consequential failure of duty occurred and who was to blame.\n\nCommissioners themselves should include notable representatives from all political persuasions. That means at least one person should be recognized as a strong progressive while another should be a high-profile Trump supporter. It's essential that people on both political poles know that their views are included and respected during the search for truth. Anything less would mean the commission's conclusions would be rejected out of hand by important segments in both parties."}

The nutjob. The skank. The slut who won't shut up. I'm the psycho liar paid by the Democratic Party. I'm the loony who deserves the death threats. I'm the kook who has it coming. I'm so nasty that @BluMrln75 says Trump wouldn't do me \"with Biden's wiener.\" And don't say you don't remember me, reader. I'm the batshit flaky bitch who warned you that Trump won't take \"no\" for an answer.\n\nAnd did you listen? Did you? Cuz now Trump won't take \"no\" from America. Trump won't take \"no\" from the voters, the Electoral College, the Supreme Court, the United States Congress, @jack, Mitch McConnell, or the PGA golf tour. He sulks, he incites, he shakes the Capitol down to the core of its spleen, and still he won't take \"no.\" So as we approach January 20, when his foul body may or may not be dragged from the White House, I thought I would just remind everyone that all this could have been avoided if everybody had simply listened, and not just to me, but to the first woman who publicly accused Trump of sexual assault two decades ago.\n\nFor six straight years she said \"no\" to Trump, she told me, and for six straight years Trump chased her, pulled her into rooms, unbuttoned his pants, phoned her, called her boyfriend a loser, and begged her to get on a plane and fly to New York, swearing over and over that he would \"be the best lover she'd ever have\" and promising, \"After me, baby, you're gonna be ruined for anyone else for the rest of your life.\"\n\n2.\n\nReader, exhibit number one is a lawsuit filed on April 30, 1997, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff: Jill Harth Houraney, a citizen of Boca Raton, Florida. The defendant: Donald J. Trump, a citizen of New York, New York. Allegations: Sexual harassment, sexual assault, attempted rape, sexual subjugation, and defamation. Request for compensation: $125 million. Complaint: Jury trial demanded. And if any man in history deserves to be tried by a jury—of about 167 million women—it is Trump. So now let us find out how this happened.\n\nJill Harth grows up in Massapequa Park, Long Island, a bunny-loving, Girl Scout–cookie-selling, lightning-bug-catching lass who, by the age of 12, is stuffed to the gills with the romance magazines her grandmother feeds her.\n\nAt Berner High School, home of the Fighting Baldwin Brothers (Jill and Danny Baldwin attend at the same time), she is not popular. She has acne. She does not make the softball team. Her favorite book is Designing Your Face, by Way Bandy. She begins mixing cosmetics to hide her pimples and experimenting with skin-care concoctions in the family kitchen. With her dad, a Rheingold Beer truck driver, yelling, What's all this oatmeal clogging the sink?, an entrepreneur is born.\n\nDo Jill Harth Beauty Cosmetics & Skincare products work? I'd better tell you right away: I look like Miss Havisham when I arrive at Jill's digs. These days, she owns a cozy apartment in the quaint part of Queens, the part that looks so much like King Henry VIII's England, all that's missing is a block for Anne Boleyn to put her head on.\n\nAfter we eat the guacamole that Jill makes, and after we have a long jaw in her mauve boudoir, Jill—a hell of a makeup artist with a bizarre client list, everyone from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michelle Pfeiffer to Bill de Blasio and George Conway—asks me to remove my COVID mask. She studies my mug for a few seconds, then hands me a lipstick called \"Natalie\" (Jill names her lipsticks after movie stars), which I proceed to slather on. Jill's mother, the jaunty Grace Harth, a former bus driver who is defying doctors' predictions of being dead and gone on account of advanced Parkinson's disease, and who is, instead, propped up in freshly laundered sheets on a giant hospital bed in the middle of Jill's living room, gazes at me and clasps her hands together. \"Oh, Jill,\" she says with heavenly pride. \"Jean looks soooo much better!\"\n\nNow back to Jill's claims in that court document.\n\n3.\n\nStatement of facts: On or about December 11, 1992, the plaintiff accompanied George Houraney to make a business presentation to the defendant, Donald J. Trump, with regard to the American Dream Festival."}

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The coronavirus pandemic has triggered permanent shifts in how and where people work. Businesses are planning for a future where more people are working from home, traveling less for business, or replacing workers with robots. All of these modifications mean many workers will not be able to do the same job they did before the pandemic, even after much of the U.S. population gets vaccinated against the deadly virus.\n\nMicrosoft founder-turned-philanthropist Bill Gates raised eyebrows in November when he predicted that half of business travel and 30 percent of \"days in the office\" would go away forever. That forecast no longer seems far-fetched. In a report coming out later this week that was previewed to The Washington Post, the McKinsey Global Institute says that 20 percent of business travel won't come back and about 20 percent of workers could end up working from home indefinitely. These shifts mean fewer jobs at hotels, restaurants and downtown shops, in addition to ongoing automation of office support roles and some factory jobs.\n\n\"We're recovering, but to a different economy,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said in November.\n\nThe nation's unemployed are starting to react to these big shifts. Two-thirds of the jobless say they have seriously considered changing their occupation or field of work, according to the Pew Research Center. That is a significant increase from the Great Recession era, when 52 percent said they were considering such a change.\n\n\"We think that there is a very real scenario in which a lot of the large employment, low-wage jobs in retail and in food service just go away in the coming years,\" said Susan Lund, head of the McKinsey Global Institute. \"It means that we're going to need a lot more short-term training and credentialing programs.\"\n\nKelly Evans lost her job during the pandemic, but has never received unemployment. As her family battles hunger, she hopes Washington acts quickly on relief. (Video: Ashleigh Joplin, Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post)\n\nOne problem for many unemployed people is they lack the money to retrain. This crisis has put many out of work for nearly a year, and the financial support from unemployment and food stamps is often not sufficient to pay their bills. The stimulus legislation being debated in Congress does not include any money for retraining.\n\n\"Trying to figure out what to do six months from now is hard when you are trying to make ends meet and you don't have enough food,\" said Brad Hershbein, who helps design and study retraining programs as a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.\n\nTake Serena Couch, who lost her job at Disney World in Orlando in April. She initially held out hope that she would be called back, but as the months went by, it became clear that that was unlikely. Now the 27-year-old has started spending her days looking for jobs and trying to learn to code by watching YouTube videos and reading blogs.\n\n\"I'm trying to learn coding on my own, because that's what everyone says to do when you're in this position,\" said Couch, who receives about $500 a month in jobless benefits, not enough to pay bills. \"I can't afford to pay for a program, so I'm just doing free programs online.\"\n\nCouch and her boyfriend, who is also laid off from a theme park, moved in with a relative to save money, and her car was repossessed around Christmas. Couch said she never intended to make a career in the hospitality industry, but without a college degree, she thought her job options were limited.\n\n\"We haven't been able to find anything that makes nearly as much as that Disney job,\" Couch said.\n\nIndeed, the number of workers in need of retraining could be in the millions, according to McKinsey and David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-wrote a report warning that automation is accelerating in the pandemic. He predicts far fewer jobs in retail, rest, car dealerships and meatpacking facilities.\n\n\"Once robots are in place, we won't go back. Once you've made that type of capital investment, you don't tend to go backward,\" Autor said. In the report he wrote, \"These developments were sure to happen over the longer run. But the crisis has pulled them forward in time.\"\n\nAutomation of jobs often speeds up during recessions, as companies look to cut costs and use periods of layoffs to experiment with new technologies. Some economists predict that there could be more automation now, because the pandemic forced companies to look for ways to minimize the number of employees in a workspace and the vast scale of the layoffs in the economy gives executives a unique opportunity to bring in robots."}

(AP) — Kathy Hochul became the first female governor of New York at the stroke of midnight Tuesday, taking control of a state government desperate to get back to business after months of distractions over sexual harassment allegations against Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\"I'll tell New Yorkers I'm up to the task. And I'm really proud to be able to serve as their governor and I won't let them down,\" she said.\n\nHochul's ascent to the top job was a history-making moment in a capital where women have only recently begun chipping away at a notoriously male-dominated political culture.\n\nCuomo left office at 12:00 a.m, two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle. He submitted his resignation letter late Monday to the leaders of the state Assembly and Senate.\n\nOn his final day in office, Cuomo released a pre-recorded farewell address in which he defended his record over a decade as New York's governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a \"media frenzy.\"\n\nHochul was scheduled to have a ceremonial swearing-in event Tuesday morning at the Capitol, with more pomp than the brief, legally required event during the night.\n\nShe planned to meet with legislative leaders later in the morning and make a public address at 3 p.m.\n\nFor the first time, a majority of the most powerful figures in New York state government will be women, including state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Attorney General Letitia James and the chief judge, DiFiore. The state Assembly is led by a man, Speaker Carl Heastie.\n\nHochul will inherit immense challenges as she takes over an administration facing criticism for inaction in Cuomo's final months.\n\nCOVID-19 has made a comeback, with new cases up nearly 1,370% since late June. Hospitalizations are climbing even as schools prepare to go back into session.\n\nBig decisions lay ahead on whether to mandate masks or vaccines for certain groups, or whether to reinstate social distancing restrictions if the state's latest wave of infections worsens. Hochul has said she favors making masks mandatory for schoolchildren, a contrast with Cuomo, who said he lacked that authority.\n\nThe economy remains unsettled. Jobs lost during the pandemic have been coming back, but unemployment remains double what it was two years ago.\n\nNew York has also struggled to get federal relief money into the hands of tenants behind on their rent because of the pandemic, releasing just 6% of the budgeted $2 billion so far. Thousands of households face the possibility of losing their homes if the state allows eviction protections to expire.\n\nHochul also faces questions about whether she'll change the culture of governance in New York, following a Cuomo administration that favored force over charm.\n\nCuomo's resignation comes after an independent investigation overseen by state Attorney General Letitia James concluded there was credible evidence he'd sexually harassed at least 11 women.\n\nIn his farewell remarks, Cuomo struck a defiant tone, saying the attorney general's report that triggered his resignation was designed to be \"a political firecracker on an explosive topic, and it did work.\"\n\n\"There was a political and media stampede,\" he said.\n\nCuomo also touted himself as a bulwark against his party's left wing, which he said wants to defund the police and demonize businesses, and boasted of making government effective in his years in office. He cited his work battling the COVID-19 pandemic, legalizing same-sex marriage and hiking the minimum wage to $15.\n\n\"I tried my best to deliver for you,\" Cuomo said.\n\nSome critics jumped on Cuomo's remarks as self-serving.\n\nAssemblymember Yuh-Line Niou, a fellow Democrat, tweeted he had a hundred million opportunities to improve as a leader and \"Chose himself every time. Goodbye, Governor Cuomo.\"\n\nCuomo's top aide, Melissa DeRosa, released a statement saying the governor was exploring his options for his post-gubernatorial life but had \"no interest in running for office again.\"\n\nCuomo's resignation won't end his legal problems."}

But in a detailed explanation posted on its blog Friday, the company said recent Trump tweets amounted to glorification of violence when read in the context of the Capitol riot and plans circulating online for future armed protests around the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nThe social platform has been under growing pressure to take further action against Trump following the Wednesday violence. On Thursday, Facebook suspended Trump's account through Jan. 20 and possibly indefinitely. Twitter merely suspended Trump's account for 12 hours after he posted a video that repeated false claims about election fraud and praised the rioters who stormed the Capitol.\n\nTrump's Twitter persona has long functioned as a mix of policy announcements, often out of the blue; complaints about the media; disparagement of women, minorities and his perceived enemies; and praise for his supporters, replete with exclamation marks, all-caps, and one-word declarations such as \"Sad!\"\n\nHe has fired numerous officials on Twitter and his posts, like his speeches at rallies, are a torrent of misinformation.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter declined to make CEO Jack Dorsey available and had no further comment.\n\nThe official account for the President of the United States, @POTUS, remains live. In fact, Trump, who issued a statement Friday evening that denounced Twitter as an enemy of free speech and floated the idea that he might build his own \"platform,\" also posted it on the @POTUS account, where it was quickly deleted.\n\nTwitter says using another account to evade a suspension is against its rules, and that while it won't ban government accounts like @POTUS or @WhiteHouse, it will \"take action to limit their use.\"\n\nShannon McGregor, an assistant professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina, said the move lets Twitter try to curry favor with the incoming Biden administration. Trump \"only has two weeks left in power, and that certainly makes it easier to deplatform the president,\" she said.\n\nOthers saw a more ominous portent in Twitter's action. \"Big Tech is not going to stop with the president of the United States,\" Kay James, president of the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, wrote in a tweet. \"They can ban you next and everyone reading this.\"\n\nIn the Trump tweets cited by Twitter, Trump stated that he will not be attending the inauguration and referred to his supporters as \"American Patriots,\" saying they will have \"a GIANT VOICE long into the future.\" Twitter said these statements \"are likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so.\"\n\nTwitter said its policy enables world leaders to speak to the public, but that these accounts \"are not above our rules entirely\" and can't use Twitter to incite violence. Trump had roughly 89 million followers. Twitter shares fell roughly 4% in after-hours trading, reflecting concerns that the Trump ban might reduce usage and advertising sales.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, who heads the Anti-Defamation League, said Friday that banning Trump was an \"excellent step\" and \"a fitting end to a legacy of spewing hate and vitriol.\" The ADL was part of a coalition of civil rights and advocacy groups on Friday calling for Twitter to ban Trump's account.\n\nTwitter, long accused of treating the president with kid gloves, began policing Trump more aggressively starting in the early days of the general presidential campaign, when the company began aggressively labeling his false tweets about supposedly widespread election fraud as disputed. An actual permanent suspension had been all but unimaginable -- at least until he lost his bid for re-election.\n\nIn May, after Trump tweeted the phrase \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\" in response to protests in Minneapolis, Twitter added a warning label to his post for the first time. Tensions between Trump and Twitter only escalated from there.\n\nBanning Trump entirely was a big step for the company — if one that it avoided taking until the president was a lame duck and its larger rival, Facebook, already banned him indefinitely."}

That decision, made in light of his encouragement for Wednesday's violent invasion of the U.S. Capitol, might seem sudden for anyone not particularly familiar with his Twitter presence.\n\nIn reality, Twitter gave Trump many, many second chances over his four years as president, keeping him on the platform due to the company's belief that speech by world leaders is in the public interest, even if it breaks the rules.\n\nNow that Trump's gone for good, we have a pretty interesting glimpse into the policy decision making that led Twitter to bring the hammer down on Friday. The company first announced Trump's ban in a series of tweets from its @TwitterSafety account but also linked to a blog post detailing its thinking.\n\nIn that deep dive, the company explains that it gave Trump one last chance after suspending and then reinstating his account for violations made on Wednesday. But the following day, a pair of tweets the president made pushed him over the line. Twitter said those tweets, pictured below, were not examined on a standalone basis, but rather in the context of his recent behavior and this week's events.\n\n\"... We have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service,\" Twitter wrote.\n\nThis is how the company explained its reasoning, point by point:\n\n\"President Trump's statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an 'orderly transition' on January 20th.\n\n\"The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a 'safe' target, as he will not be attending.\n\n\"The use of the words 'American Patriots' to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.\n\n\"The mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election.\n\n\"Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021.\""}

It began with a May 4, 2009, tweet promoting Donald Trump's upcoming appearance on David Letterman's show.\n\nIt died more than 57,000 tweets later, with Trump using some of his final postings on the powerful platform to commiserate with a pro-Trump mob that besieged the halls of Congress in a deadly assault as lawmakers were set to certify his defeat.\n\nThe account met its demise when Twitter announced Friday it was pulling the plug permanently on @realDonaldTrump, citing concern that Trump would use it for \"further incitement of violence.\" Trump retorted that he'd be \"building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED!\"\n\nTrump, a novice politician but seasoned salesman, realized the power of social media in ways that few other politicians did. And he wielded it with never-before-seen power to diminish his opponents, shape elections and mold reality — at least in the eyes of his supporters.\n\nEarly on, @realDonaldTrump seemed innocent enough. Its owner, who had prolific experience in marketing casinos, real estate and even Oreos, used the platform mostly to promote his books, media appearances and give friendly plugs to friends.\n\nBut as Trump began seriously toying with a White House run, it became a tool to scorch opponents and give shape to his nationalist, \"America First\" philosophy.\n\nHe deployed its venom equally, whether insulting celebrity enemies (Rosie O'Donnell was \"crude, rude, obnoxious and dumb\") or using xenophobia to malign a country (Britain is \"trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem\").\n\nPeter Costanzo, then an online marketing director for the publishing company putting out Trump's book, \"Think Like a Champion,\" helped bring Trump to the platform.\n\nTwitter was still in its infancy at the time. But Costanzo, who later came to work for The Associated Press, saw the then-140-character-per-message platform as a new tool that the real estate mogul could use to boost sales and reach a broader audience.\n\nCostanzo was given seven minutes to make his pitch to Trump — \"Not five minutes, not 10,\" he recalled in a 2016 interview.\n\nTrump liked what he heard.\n\n\"I said, 'Let's call you @realDonaldTrump — you're the real Donald Trump,'\" recalled Costanzo. \"He thought about it for a minute and said: 'I like it.

But civil rights groups and lawmakers say the internet companies allowed misleading content to proliferate for too long, resulting in dangerous – and deadly – consequences.\n\n\"Despite repeated red flags and demands for fixes, these companies failed to act until well after blood and glass lay in the halls of the Capitol,\" Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said in an interview. \"Yesterday's events will renew and focus the need for Congress to reform Big Tech's privileges and obligations.\"\n\nSome lawmakers are considering offering measures that would require more transparency about political ads on the internet, such as who paid for them. Civil rights and other advocates say they hope public outrage over the insurrection will spur internet companies to bolster their voluntary efforts to tamp down online propaganda.\n\n\"We're going to be talking about how to regulate and rein these companies in,\" said Jessica Gonzlez, co-chief executive officer of Free Press, which pushes for media accountability. \"But gosh, it shouldn't be this hard to do the right thing.\"\n\nA large group of Trump supporters, with the president's encouragement, stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, delaying the certification of Joe Biden's election, which Trump has repeatedly and without basis called fraudulent. Trump had used Twitter, Facebook and Google's YouTube to urge supporters to strike out, and for hours said nothing as the mob grew violent. Once he urged the crowd to be peaceful, he repeated his claim that the election had been stolen from him.\n\nFacebook said Thursday it was extending a 24-hour ban on Trump's posts for at least two weeks until Biden takes office. Twitter suspended Trump's account for 12 hours on the condition that he remove three tweets, including a Wednesday video in which Trump expressed his love for the insurgents and called the election fraudulent. A spokesperson confirmed that Trump had deleted the offending tweets, giving him access to his account. But Twitter warned that Trump could receive a permanent suspension if he continued to break its rules.\n\nIn his first tweet since gaining access to his account, Trump on Thursday evening posted a video in which he condemned the riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol and said he would prepare for a smooth presidential transition.\n\nYouTube also removed Trump's Wednesday video. The company said he will accumulate \"strikes\" against his account for continued violations, which could block him from uploading content in the future. Twitch, the live-streaming service owned by Amazon.com Inc., disabled Trump's account indefinitely while Snap Inc. banned the president from posting on its Snapchat app until further notice.\n\nThe bans, while unprecedented, were too little and too late for some. \"Facebook has finally taken the long-overdue step of blocking the President's account – at least for the next 13 days – but I'm deeply frustrated that it took a group of domestic terrorists storming the Capitol before they were willing to do so,\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said in a statement on Thursday. \"I also can't help but wonder if the decision was an opportunistic one, motivated by the news of a Democratically controlled Congress.\"\n\nThompson and civil rights advocates are calling on the social media companies to remove the president's accounts altogether.\n\nTrump, through a spokesman, decried the bans. \"It is indisputable that nobody has been more successful at using digital media than President Trump to communicate directly with the American people,\" said White House spokesman Judd Deere. \"But it's incredibly ironic, yet not surprising, that when the President spoke to the country at a critical time Big Tech chose to censor and block him from doing so.

More than a third of Americans – 36% – said they were concerned about censorship, but that view was not held by the majority: 69% said social media companies should be able to remove users they consider dangerous, even if it's the president of the United States.\n\nAnd 40% of Americans say Trump should have been banned earlier and described Twitter's removal as \"too little, too late.\"\n\nThirty-seven percent of the 1,951 American adults surveyed over the weekend said they were embarrassed that Trump was banned.\n\nFifty-eight percent of those surveyed agreed with the statement \"President Trump's actions this week were dangerous and removing him from Twitter was the correct thing to do.\" Forty-two percent agreed with the statement \"I am concerned that Twitter permanently suspending President Trump sets a dangerous precedent with technology companies censoring free speech and government officials.\"\n\nAnother poll from Morning Consult released Tuesday found that half of the 2,200 Americans surveyed over the weekend about Twitter's permanent ban and Facebook's temporary ban believe social media companies should have cut off Trump earlier. About 39% of the Americans surveyed said the temporary ban was \"exactly right,\"\n\nBut again opinions differed by party: 69% of Republicans said the suspensions went too far, while 43% said they didn't go far enough."}

(Video: The Washington Post)\n\nThe president and his supporters also have lost accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, Spotify, Shopify and others. Facebook called Trump's suspension \"indefinite\" but left open the possibility that the account could later be restored.\n\nThe findings, from Jan. 9 through Friday, highlight how falsehoods flow across social media sites — reinforcing and amplifying each other — and offer an early indication of how concerted actions against misinformation can make a difference.\n\nTwitter's ban of Trump on Jan. 8, after years in which @realDonaldTrump was a potent online megaphone, has been particularly significant in curbing his ability to push misleading claims about what state and federal officials have called a free and fair election on Nov. 3.\n\nTrump's banishment was followed by other actions by social media sites, including Twitter's ban of more than 70,000 accounts affiliated with the baseless QAnon ideology, which played a key role in fomenting the Capitol siege on Jan. 6.\n\n\"Together, those actions will likely significantly reduce the amount of online misinformation in the near term,\" said Kate Starbird, disinformation researcher at the University of Washington. \"What happens in the long term is still up in the air.\"\n\nZignal found that the use of hashtags affiliated with the Capitol riot also dipped considerably. Mentions of the hashtag #FightforTrump, which was widely deployed across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media services in the week before the rally, dropped 95 percent. #HoldTheLine and the term \"March for Trump\" also fell more than 95 percent.\n\nThe research by Zignal and other groups suggests that a powerful, integrated disinformation ecosystem — composed of high-profile influencers, rank-and-file followers and Trump himself — was central to pushing millions of Americans to reject the election results and may have trouble surviving without his social media accounts."}

The legal team is being led by John P. Coale, a trial attorney involved in lawsuits against big tobacco companies.\n\n\"We're going to hold big tech very accountable,\" Trump said during the press conference at his Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey. \"If they can do it to me, they can do it to anyone.\"\n\nTwitter permanently banned Trump in January for his role in stoking the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6 in a deadly riot to stop the counting of Electoral College votes for President Joe Biden. Facebook last month said Trump would remain suspended from its networks for at least two years, with the possibility of being reinstated in 2023 if risk to public safety has subsided.\n\nYouTube, Google's giant video service, also froze Trump's account following the Jan. 6 riot. The former president's videos are still accessible, but he isn't permitted to post new videos. Susan Wojcicki, YouTube's chief executive, has said that the company will reverse its policy when it decides that the \"risk of violence has decreased,\" without providing details.\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the suits, which were criticized by tech-funded advocacy groups. NetChoice, whose members include Amazon and other tech companies, said the action shows a \"deliberate misunderstanding of the First Amendment\" and is without merit.\n\n\"President Trump has no case,\" NetChoice CEO Steve DelBianco said in a release. \"The First Amendment is designed to protect the media from the President, not the other way around.\"\n\nTrump is seeking to overturn a federal law that shields internet companies from liability for content posted by users. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act protects social media platforms from lawsuits accusing them of unfairly removing posts or accounts, among other legal challenges. The First Amendment prohibits the government from forcing tech companies to leave up or take down certain categories of posts.\n\nIn the lawsuits, Trump argues the liability protections under Section 230 means social media companies should be considered government actors that can be sued.\n\nThe banishment of Trump by major tech platforms reignited Republican calls to revoke the legal shield, arguing that it has enabled social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to censor conservative viewpoints.\n\nThe lawsuits aren't the first time Trump has taken aim at Section 230. While in office, he tried to get Congress to repeal Section 230 by threatening to veto a Defense Department spending bill. Democrats have also proposed bills to curtail the legal shield to encourage tech companies to more aggressively rid their platforms of bigotry, abuse, and harassment.\n\nTech companies have largely resisted changes to the law, fearing that the proliferation of lawsuits will force them to clamp down on the free-flowing user-generated content. However, both Zuckerberg and Dorsey have expressed openness in recent months to Section 230 reforms.\n\nWithout access to the broad reach afforded by social media giants, Trump has struggled to maintain an online presence. He shut down his blog-like \"From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,\" though he frequently sends out several press statements a day — often targeting fellow Republicans he believes are insufficiently loyal.\n\nTrump recently stepped up his public activity by restarting rallies and making a trip to the southern U.S. border last week to criticize Biden's immigration policies. He's backing candidates in the 2022 midterm elections and actively opposing others. He has also held out the prospect of running again for president in 2024.\n\nThe former president has been teasing that he'll launch a new platform that can't remove him. He said on Dave Rubin's \"Rubin Report\" podcast on June 25 that \"there's a lot of platforms out there, that's what we're looking at, getting the right platform, a perfect platform, and I think you'll see something fairly soon.\"\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump used Twitter for everything from insulting rivals to major policy announcements, and he relied on Facebook especially to raise money from small-dollar donors.\n\nA Florida law prohibiting social media platforms from suspending the accounts of political candidates was blocked by a federal judge earlier this month. Likening the state's law to \"burning the house to roast a pig,\" U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee said the legislation passed by a Republican legislature and a priority of Governor Ron DeSantis, violates the companies' free speech rights.\n\nThe case is Trump et al v Twitter Inc et al, 21-cv-22441, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami)."}

We also recognize that Facebook is a private entity with its own First Amendment rights to control the content it publishes. But Facebook's decision to ban Trump nonetheless illustrates serious shortcomings in its content-related decision making — as its own Oversight Board (OB) properly declared yesterday in reviewing the decision. Facebook exercises quasi-monopoly power over a critical forum in our marketplace of ideas, and for many of the same reasons that we would be suspicious of a central government authority controlling what can and cannot be said, we have concerns with Facebook exercising such unchecked power.\n\nThe OB ruled that Facebook's initial decision to suspend former President Trump's account for 24 hours on Jan. 6, 2021, after the attack on the Capitol, was proper, but that its subsequent decision to suspend his account indefinitely — a sanction that is not mentioned in Facebook's policies — was inappropriate. The board put the decision about a permanent ban back in Facebook's hands, to be made in the next six months according to the rules the company applies to other users.\n\nAs pernicious as Trump's speech was, the decisions by Facebook and other social media companies to remove Trump from their platforms highlight the immense power these corporations wield over our collective ability to speak online. For the foreseeable future, Facebook, Twitter, and a handful of other corporations will make some of the most consequential decisions affecting free expression. They present themselves as platforms for free speech rather than edited or curated newspapers. But historically they have failed to apply their own rules consistently, equitably, and transparently, or to adhere to basic notions of fair process in how they exercise the awesome power to decide what gets published on, and who can access, their forums.\n\nPerfectly consistent content moderation is impossible in light of the scale at which these platforms operate. But Facebook's failure to abide by basic principles of fairness and transparency are unacceptable given the influence they exert over our national debate. Facebook and similar platforms should err on the side of free expression, not censorship, while also offering users direct control over the content they see. Facebook effectively determines the boundaries of political speech for billions of users, even as it remains beholden to its bottom line, not the public interest.\n\nIn an attempt to add some accountability and transparency, Facebook created an Oversight Board to help it review hard questions regarding content moderation. But the company still holds too much unaccountable power over the process. The OB rightly highlighted many concerns with Facebook policies and practices that we share, but the decision also leaves crucial questions unanswered. Below we break down our take on this issue and the board's decision.\n\nWhat does the ACLU think of the Oversight Board's decision?"}

Trump's account was also indefinitely disabled on Twitch, a US live and streaming service that belongs to Amazon.\n\nThe bans came as pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol building in Washington DC. The riot interrupted a joint congressional session to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nWhat led to the ban?\n\nTrump posted a video on Twitter and Facebook more than two hours after protesters entered the Capitol and as authorities struggled to take control of the situation.\n\nTrump opened his video saying, \"I know your pain. I know your hurt. But you have to go home now.\"\n\nHe repeated claims of voter fraud in the video. He also appealed to his supporters, saying \"We don't want anybody hurt,\" adding: \"We can't play into the hands of these people.\"\n\nDirectly addressing his supporters in the video, he said: \"We love you, you're very special.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers and previous administration officials had reportedly begged Trump to call on his supporters to quell the violence.\n\n'This is the worst day for this country' To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHow did Facebook respond?\n\nFacebook said it was \"indefinitely\" banning Trump's accounts, including on Instagram, according to a post by founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n\"Over the last several years, we have allowed President Trump to use our platform consistent with our own rules, at times removing content or labeling his posts when they violate our policies. We did this because we believe that the public has a right to the broadest possible access to political speech, even controversial speech. But the current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\n\"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great. Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.\"\n\nFacebook earlier removed Trump's video. Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, said on Twitter Wednesday that the video was removed because it \"contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.\"\n\n\"This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video,\" Rosen said.\n\nFacebook also removed a text post from Trump, which sought to justify the attack, telling supporters to \"remember this day forever!\"\n\nHow did Twitter respond?\n\nFollowing the video upload, Twitter locked Trump out of his account for 12 hours. The Twitter Safety account cited \"repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy.\"\n\nThe company required the removal of three of Trump's tweets, including the video, and warned: \"If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked.\"\n\nTrump's account has since deleted those posts, Twitter said.\n\nIt said further violations of Twitter rules would result in permanent suspension."}

On Wednesday, the White House Twitter account shared a video statement from Trump. He didn't directly address tech companies, but he hinted at the issue with a jab at the \"unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days.\"\n\n\"These are tense and difficult times,\" he said in an uncharacteristically calm statement. \"The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous.

The newly formed Alphabet Workers Union, a collection of Google employees and contractors, put out a statement saying YouTube's actions in taking down just one video were \"lackluster, demonstrating a continued policy of selective and insufficient enforcement of its guidelines.\"\n\nYouTube has a three-strike process when deciding which channels to take down, which directly affects the speed at which it moves. Facebook also has a strike system, but big, complex decisions often roll up directly to Sandberg and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. At Twitter, decisions are made by the company's policy team and signed off on by CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nYouTube's process can seem \"frustratingly slow,\" but the company actually has more of a thought-out process than Twitter and Facebook, said Jim Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense Media, which advocates for safer technology for children. The suspension of Trump is a positive first step, but the ban should be made permanent, he said.\n\n\"I think all the platforms missed this one,\" Steyer said, saying they should have acted earlier to crack down on misinformation Trump shared.\n\nIt's not the first time YouTube specifically has come under fire for moving too slowly."}

Trump from their platforms after the Capitol riot in January, he lost direct access to his most powerful megaphones. On Friday, Facebook said the former president would not be allowed back on its service until at least January 2023, citing a risk to public safety.\n\nSince his ban and President Biden's inauguration, he has posted statements online far less often. But some of his statements have traveled just as far and wide on social networks.\n\nThe reach of Trump's words before and after his ban from social media Each circle represents a statement made by Mr. Trump. The size of a circle is determined by the number of likes and shares the statement generated across Twitter, Instagram and Facebook on posts quoting it, including on Mr. Trump's own account before he was banned. Tallies of likes and shares come from the 100 most highly liked and shared posts on Facebook and Instagram for each Trump statement. (In most cases, there were fewer than 100 posts quoting each statement.) On Twitter, any posts quoting a given Trump statement that had at least 10 retweets were included.\n\nThe New York Times examined Mr. Trump's nearly 1,600 social media posts from Sept. 1 to Jan. 8, the day Mr. Trump was banned from the platforms. We then tracked the social media engagement with the dozens of written statements he made on his personal website, campaign fund-raising site and in email blasts from Jan. 9 until May 5, which was the day that the Facebook Oversight Board, which reviews some content decisions by the company, said that the company acted appropriately in kicking him off the service.\n\nBefore the ban, the social media post with the median engagement generated 272,000 likes and shares. After the ban, that dropped to 36,000 likes and shares. Yet 11 of his 89 statements after the ban attracted as many likes or shares as the median post before the ban, if not more.\n\nHow does that happen?\n\nMr. Trump had long been his own best promoter on social media. The vast majority of people on Twitter and Facebook interacted directly with Mr. Trump's posts, either liking or sharing them, The Times analysis found.\n\nBut after the ban, other popular social media accounts often picked up his messages and posted them themselves. (Last week, Mr. Trump shut down his blog, one of the places he made statements.)\n\nOn Oct. 8, Mr. Trump tweeted that the then-Democratic presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his running mate, Kamala Harris, lied \"constantly.\" The post was liked and shared 501,000 times on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nOn March 21, Mr. Trump published a statement on his website saying that his administration had handed over \"the most secure border in history.\" He went on to criticize the Biden administration's handling of the border crisis. \"Our Country is being destroyed!\" Mr. Trump said. The statement was liked and shared more than 661,000 times.\n\nThe Global Disinformation Index, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies disinformation, examined the political leanings of the top accounts sharing Mr. Trump's statements online after he was barred from Facebook and Twitter. The group classified hundreds of accounts as either left- or right-leaning, or a mix of the two, relying on standards that it established through its work on disinformation risk ratings for news sites and other online media.\n\nOne thing that became immediately clear: Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters continue to spread his message — doing the work that he had been unable to do himself.\n\nThe top sharers of the March post included the right-wing publication Breitbart News (159,500 likes and shares), a Facebook page called \"President Donald Trump Fan Club\" (48,200 likes), Fox News (42,000 likes), and Jenna Ellis (36,700 likes), a lawyer who made regular television appearances as Mr. Trump's proxy to trumpet his debunked claims of a rigged election.\n\nBut when Mr. Trump criticizes conservatives, his remarks sometimes get picked up by both the left and right.\n\nOn Feb. 16, for instance, Mr. Trump derided Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, because of Mr. McConnell's unwillingness to back Mr. Trump's attempts to undermine the 2020 election."}

The spokesperson cited Twitter's platform manipulation and spam rules, which prohibit users from running fake accounts and using multiple accounts to \"artificially amplify or disrupt conversations,\" though the company did not point to a specific infraction. O'Keefe told Forbes in a statement he plans on suing Twitter for defamation next week, denying that he ever operated fake accounts.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"This is false, this is defamatory, and they will pay,\" O'Keefe said in a statement, which was sent through a Project Veritas spokesperson and posted to his Telegram account. \"Section 230 may have protected them before, but it will not protect them from me.\"\n\nKey Background\n\nProject Veritas is known for carrying out hidden-camera stings on media outlets and left-wing groups, and it's often accused of posting deceptive videos and spreading out-of-context claims (the group has denied these allegations). Most recently, the group released a string of videos targeting CNN: It leaked audio from months' worth of CNN editorial meetings last year, and it posted videos of an apparent CNN staffer claiming the network deliberately tried to undermine former President Donald Trump and his allies.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nProject Veritas was itself suspended from Twitter two months ago for violating the social network's private information policy. O'Keefe was also temporarily locked out of his account at the time, but he was later reinstated.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nIf O'Keefe follows through on suing Twitter, it won't be his first defamation suit. Project Veritas is currently suing the New York Times for calling one of its reports \"deceptive,\" and he threatened to sue CNN for similar reasons this week.

They were worried for their colleagues' safety — some had already received security threats. But they were also angry that Gadde's team had let President Trump's account back onto the service after a 12-hour ban for appearing to encourage the Capitol rioters on the day of the failed insurrection. He had already tweeted again, telling followers they were patriots who would not be disrespected.\n\nLess than three hours after Gadde's emergency meeting, Twitter banned Trump forever. In an instant, the megaphone of the leader of the free world was wiped out, along with his following of 88 million he had built throughout his presidency — some of whom amplified his every word. And it brought to an end an era of free speech online that Twitter — which a senior executive once referred to as \"the free speech wing of the free speech party\" — had itself helped create.\n\nTwitter on Jan. 8 banned President Trump from its site, a punishment for his role in inciting violence at the U.S. Capitol.

Dominion has since filed a $1.3 billion defamation suit against former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell.\n\nTuesday's Newsmax segment featuring Lindell, a Trump ally, was set up to discuss his Twitter suspensions and whether they fit into the larger context of \"cancel culture.\" Last week, Twitter permanently banned Lindell's personal account for perpetuating the falsehood that the election was rigged.

We don't want to re-litigate the allegations that you're making, Mike,\" Sellers said as Lindell spoke over him, gesticulating toward the camera.\n\nWhen the anchor followed up by asking whether Lindell could make an argument that the Twitter ban should be temporary, not permanent, the My Pillow magnate went back to his earlier claims."}

For years, the president has used his Twitter account to reach his nearly 90 million now-former followers on the platform as a means to bypass traditional media. Many critics have long argued that Twitter should take a firmer stance against Trump due to his dangerous use of the platform to spread lies and violent rhetoric.\n\nWhile some may see the move as too little, too late, and Trump's supporters are questioning it entirely, it nevertheless marks a historic exertion of Twitter's ability to influence politics during a time when the strength of democracy in the US is being seriously tested.\n\n\"In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action,\" read a company blog post on Friday explaining the decision. Despite the fact that Twitter has generally allowed world leaders like Trump to post more controversial content than the average user since their tweets are deemed newsworthy, the company said that these accounts are still \"not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things.\"\n\nAhead of the permanent ban, Twitter had previously temporarily suspended Trump's tweets on Wednesday for violating its policies on civic integrity and violence, and warned that it may permanently suspend him if he continued to violate its policies. Now, users can no longer see Trump's tweets, and the president is unable to post on his account.\n\nThe move comes as hundreds of Twitter's own employees urged CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend Trump permanently, according to a report by the Washington Post.\n\nThe day before Twitter's permanent suspension, Facebook blocked Trump's account on its platform, which has tens of millions of followers, from posting and emphasized that the ban would be in place for at least two weeks until President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\nRecent events leading to the decision\n\nTwitter's official explanation for why it permanently blocked Trump's account was that his last two tweets violated the company's Glorification of Violence policy and were part of a broader pattern of encouraging violence during the transition of presidential powers. Twitter specifically cited a concern that Trump's followers seemed to interpret his announcement about not attending Biden's inauguration as a signal that it would be a \"safe\" target for violent acts.\n\nThe first tweet that pushed Trump past Twitter's tipping point stated that he would not attend Joe Biden's inauguration. The second declared that the \"75,000,000 great American Patriots\" who voted for Trump would not be \"disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\""}

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Sen. Amanda F. Chase (R-Chesterfield), who spoke to the crowd of President Trump's supporters in Washington on Wednesday but left before they crashed through Capitol security, cannot post or comment for seven days, or post live video for 60 days on her official Senate page, according to a written notice she shared with The Washington Post. She announced Facebook's actions on her personal Facebook page, which was not affected.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the liberal left who controls social media is systematically targeting vocal supporters of President Trump in an all-out, collaborative effort to silence our voices,\" she said in an interview. \"Facebook has weaponized its community standards.\"\n\nSome Trump allies have speculated that antifa was responsible for inciting violence and storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. No evidence supports this claim. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nA spokesman for Facebook did not respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nThe restrictions on Chase follow a crackdown on Trump by social media companies, who say his posts helped incite the riot. Twitter on Friday night announced it was permanently suspending Trump's account \"due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" while Facebook announced Thursday it was banning Trump indefinitely.\n\nFacebook has flagged several of Chase's recent posts with the tag: \"False information. Checked by independent fact-checkers.\" That includes one post that claimed, \"Facial recognition firm claims Antifa infiltrated Trump Supporters.\"\n\nTwitter on Jan. 8 banned President Trump from its site, a punishment for his role in inciting violence at the U.S. Capitol. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nEven as Chase claimed the left was responsible for the riot, she praised the \"patriots\" who stormed the Capitol.\n\n\"These were not rioters and looters; these were Patriots who love their country and do not want to see our great republic turn into a socialist country. I was there with the people; I know. Don't believe the fake media narrative,\" Chase had written.\n\nThe state Senate's Democratic Caucus on Friday called on Chase — who last month said Trump should hang on to power by declaring martial law — to resign, accusing her of \"empowering a failed coup d'etat.\"\n\nChase brushed off their criticism, saying Virginia Democrats had \"committed treason\" by loosening restrictions on voting last year by eliminating photo ID requirements, among other things.\n\nThe Senate Republican Caucus, which Chase quit in November 2019, declined to comment.\n\nA suburbanite who got interested in politics as a home-schooling mom and worked for GOP establishment figure Eric Cantor before the tea party movement toppled him in 2014, Chase has been a controversial figure even within her own party. The rift became public in 2019, after she cursed out a Virginia Capitol Police officer over a parking space.\n\nWhile fellow Virginia Republicans have rarely crossed Trump, Chase has gone further than most with inflammatory rhetoric. In mid-December, as her lone rival for the GOP gubernatorial nomination, Del. Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights), acknowledged President-elect Joe Biden's win in the electoral college, Chase urged Trump to declare \"martial law\" to prevent his removal from office."}

Facebook (FB) had blocked Trump's accounts \"indefinitely\" a day earlier, a suspension that was upheld in May by the company's court-like Oversight Board and is up for review again in November. Google-owned YouTube announced a suspension of Trump's channel a week later but has left the door open for him to return to the platform.\n\nTwitter's decision to remove Trump didn't happen immediately. The platform initially banned Trump for 12 hours on January 6. Twitter took heat when it let him back on and he quickly tweeted again, calling his followers who stormed the Capitol \"patriots.\" The Washington Post detailed a January 8 meeting in which Gadde made an \"impassioned appeal\" for staffers to have patience as her team deliberated what to do. Hours later, Twitter banned Trump permanently.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Gadde played a central role in the Trump ban decision. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was reportedly vacationing on a private island at the time. (Twitter has said Dorsey was closely involved in the decision.) Asked this month about her role in banning Trump, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business: \"Policy enforcement decisions are made by our Trust and Safety team, which report to Vijaya Gadde.\" The spokesperson also said Twitter has \"no plans to reinstate\" Trump's account.\n\n\"Vijaya is at the crossroads of some of the most important policy decisions the company is making and how it interacts with governments around the world.\" Former Twitter COO Adam Bain"}

In 2019, Twitter said it was working on Bluesky, a project focused on creating \"an open and decentralized standard for social media\" that could help the site better combat online abuse and misinformation. The social network also began testing a forum called Birdwatch that lets users spot misleading tweets and weigh in on why they think the information is wrong.\n\n\"We want to stay ahead of where the market is moving and where people are moving,\" Dorsey said at Goldman Sachs' virtual Technology and Internet Conference on Wednesday. \"I believe so much that this trend will come to pass.\"\n\nIn the 40-minute interview, Dorsey spoke about a variety of topics, including regulation and Twitter's plans to explore revenue outside of advertising.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\nMoving beyond the tweet: Twitter needs to move beyond 280-character tweets in order to add to the \"public conversational layer of the internet,\" Dorsey said. The company has been testing \"fleets,\" a tool that lets you share content that disappears in 24 hours. It's also been experimenting with an audio chatroom feature called Spaces, and acquired the newsletter platform Revue. Twitter is trying to make it easier to follow topics and interests.\n\nTwitter can also become a place for recruiting, Dorsey said, noting that people are using the site to find others they want to work with or to share interests. \"We don't want to be seen as just the thing that shows you what's happening right now,\" he said.\n\nRegulation: US lawmakers have been eyeing changes to a federal law called Section 230 that shields internet companies from liability for content posted by users. Dorsey referred to the growing debate, saying more transparency around content moderation was needed. But he also noted that changing Section 230 could impact online reviews, message boards and other content on the internet. Twitter is in \"active discussions with regulators,\" he said, but cautioned that some proposals could reduce competition or \"the spirit of an open Internet.\"\n\nContent moderation: Twitter's efforts to label misinformation and its permanent ban of former President Donald Trump have rubbed some conservative users the wrong way, prompting them to bolt from the platform to explore alternatives, such as Parler and Gab. Dorsey, though, doesn't seem too worried about a drop in daily users. He said that 80% of Twitter's users are outside the US and that the service has more than 50 accounts with more than 25 million followers."}

Ron DeSantis held a hastily-called news conference to announce a proposal to penalize social media companies for blocking politicians, even if they incite violence.\n\n\"We've seen the power of their censorship over individuals and organizations, including what I believe is clear viewpoint discrimination,'' said DeSantis as Florida's Senate president and House speaker stood at his side. \"Under our proposal, if a technology company de-platforms a candidate for elected office in Florida during the election, a company will face a daily fine of $100,000 until the candidate's access to the platform is restored again.\"\n\nThe proposed bill, which is still being drafted, asks the Florida Legislature to impose penalties for social media companies whose algorithms are perceived to favor one candidate over another. It builds on SB 520, filed by state Sen. Danny Burgess, that would require the platforms to give a 30-day notice to a user whose account has been disabled or suspended and explain why the user was punished.\n\nAlthough the governor never mentioned the former president, who was banned by Facebook and Twitter after they said he used his accounts to incite violence and disseminate conspiracy theories about the election, the timing of the announcement coincided with the filing by Trump's lawyers in the pending impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn a 14-page brief, lawyers David Schoen and Bruce Castor wrote that when Trump told his supporters \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore\" it was not meant as a reference to violent action but was intended to be \"about the need to fight for election security in general.\"\n\nThey also denied that Trump had incited the riot by disputing the election results or by exhorting his followers to action. By contrast, the U.S. House accuses Trump of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for inciting the violent insurrection.\n\n\"The actions by the House make clear that in their opinion the 45th president does not enjoy the protections of liberty upon which this great nation was founded, where free speech, and indeed, free political speech form the backbone of all American liberties,\" the defense lawyers wrote.\n\nDeSantis, whose allegiance to Trump began when the former president used his Twitter account to endorse DeSantis over his Republican primary rivals in the 2018 Florida election for governor, blasted \"the big tech oligarchy\" for being \"more of a clear and present danger to the rights of free speech, than the government itself.\"\n\nHe accused the social media companies of having a bias against conservatives because they didn't ban from their accounts the supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement and Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, both of whom DeSantis said used their accounts to incite violence.\n\n\"They have so much garbage and filth on that platform, all the time,'' he said. \"They did not censor people when they were using those platforms for the rioting that occurred over the summer, so their excuse doesn't hold water.\""}

Twitch took Trump's suspension one step further Wednesday by removing his account from the platform entirely, ensuring he can't appeal the ban or create another account. A Twitch spokesperson said the company decided to ban him permanently because \"the President's statements continue to be interpreted as calls to action, and we are taking this action to remove the potential for harm to our community and the general public.\" Twitch also banned the popular PogChamp emote earlier this month after the face of the emote, Ryan \"Gootecks\" Gutierrez, encouraged further \"civil unrest\" following the riot.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"Twitch has clear rules that prohibit hateful conduct, harassment, or incitement of violence on our service, and we consider off-service events when making enforcement decisions.

Facebook has also indefinitely banned the former president, and COO Sheryl Sandberg it's unlikely the company will allow him back. For the last two months, Trump has used his megaphone on social media to promote unfounded conspiracy theories about election fraud, which critics say directly contributed to his supporters storming the Capitol.\n\nTangent\n\nPoliticians have increasingly turned to gaming platforms as potent digital messaging tools to reach younger audiences.

We've seen Khamenei's call for the elimination of Israel, which is incitement. So if Twitter has a policy against incitement of violence, it needs to be applied uniformly.\"\n\nA Twitter spokesperson responded to the accusations of double standards in enforcing incitement prohibitions by telling VOA Persian that the platform has taken enforcement action against world leaders prior to Friday.\n\nThe spokesperson said Twitter focused its Friday actions on what he called the \"harm presented by [Trump's personal] account specifically,\" and shared a link to Twitter's statement explaining why it believes Trump's last tweets have the potential to incite further violence following Wednesday's storming of the U.S. Capitol complex by some of his supporters.\n\nAsked what Twitter is doing to demonstrate that it is treating world leaders consistently, the spokesperson said the company's policy of displaying a \"government account\" label for users affiliated with the five permanent member states of the U.N. Security Council will soon be expanded to include similar labeling for the officials of other nations. No further details were provided.\n\nTwitter's action against the Khamenei account came hours before its banning of Trump.\n\nThe Khamenei account had posted a Friday tweet in which the Iranian supreme leader called coronavirus vaccines produced by the U.S., Britain and France \"completely untrustworthy\" and accused the Western powers of trying to \"contaminate\" other nations by offering to send them the vaccines.\n\nThe Khamenei tweet prompted Iranian activists such as VOA Persian TV show host Masih Alinejad to urge Twitter to suspend his account for spreading misinformation about the vaccines. Twitter removed the tweet from public view after several hours."}

Trump posted a short video that day in which he pledged to support a peaceful transition of power.\n\nTime and again, Trump tested the boundaries of what he could say, violating the company's rules against election misinformation, glorifying violence and falsehoods about COVID-19.

The ban has slowed or altogether halted legal immigration from certain countries that the former administration deemed to be security threats, keeping families apart and even stymieing refugee resettlement.\n\nThe travel ban was Trump's first major action on immigration policy, setting the tone for the chaotic four years that followed for immigrants while galvanizing public opposition.\n\nWhen the ban was announced, it resulted in mass protests in airports across the US where people from the affected countries, which were initially limited to those with majority-Muslim populations, were held for questioning for hours.\n\nThis led immigrant advocates to call it a discriminatory \"Muslim ban,\" citing Trump's campaign promise to establish a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" Democrats in Congress, who for years had expressed conflicting positions on immigration policy, coalesced in opposition to the policy, using it to present a united front in condemnation of the xenophobia it represented.\n\nThe ban was amended several times in the face of numerous court challenges arguing that Trump did not have the legal authority to issue it and that it unlawfully discriminated against Muslims. The third version of the ban, ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court, barred citizens of seven countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela, and North Korea — from obtaining any kind of visas, largely preventing them from entering the US. (Chad was taken off the list of countries subject to the ban in April 2019 after it met the Trump administration's demands to share information with US authorities that could aid in efforts to vet foreigners.)"}

Shortly afterwards, he tweeted out a similar message in text. \"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,\" the President tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. \"Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\"\n\nAt first, Twitter reacted by locking down both messages, so that they could not be liked, retweeted or replied to, before ultimately suspending the account for 12 hours. On Friday, after the suspension was lifted, Trump only tweeted twice. The first was to praise those who voted for him, saying that they \"will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\" His last tweet, at least from this suspended account, was an announcement that he would not attend Biden's inauguration.\n\nFrom the cryptic \"Covfefe\" to caps-lock declarations of \"WITCH HUNT,\" in many ways Twitter has defined his presidency. To his more than 88 million followers, he wielded it like a policy wishlist, a cudgel to publicly scorn his enemies or fire members of his Administration and his preferred way to offer political endorsements.\n\nEspecially over the past year, both Trump's usage of Twitter and his criticism of the company has increased. During 2020 and in the run up to the election, he would tweet and retweet sometimes 200 tweets a day. In May 2020, Trump tweeted a baseless allegation that the use of mail in ballots in elections would be \"substantially fraudulent\" and, for the first time, Twitter flagged it as an \"unsubstantiated claim.\" As the President continued to spread misinformation about elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter continued to crack down on his tweets, with escalated warnings.\n\nTrump and other prominent Republicans said they viewed Twitter's moves as censorship, and have called for the repeal of Section 230, part of an Internet legislative act passed in 1996 which would change the rules by which litigation could be brought against social media companies. Trump's own interest in repealing this sliver of the law was so great that last month he vetoed a bi-partisan defense spending bill for not including language that would defend him against his perceived censorship. Congress has since overrode his veto."}

There have already been a couple dozen arrests, and many more are certain to come. There is an active federal investigation of the murder of a police officer at the hands of the pro-Trump mob, and media and political figures have raised the prospect of Trump's criminal exposure for the bloodshed. There will certainly be convictions and prison sentences.\n\nBut it is quite likely that this fate will only apply to those unfamous citizens who joined the mob, not their ideological masters.\n\nWhen it comes to holding the most powerful responsible for their role in crimes, particularly those committed while holding high office, the U.S. track record is anemic. While Democrats are rightly intent on proceeding with impeachment and other measures against Trump, the reality is that U.S. history is rife with episodes of political elites ultimately deciding to move on \"for the good of the country.\" It is why so many shameless Republicans are whining about the need to unify the country so it can heal. They know the game.\n\nListening to many Democrats and some Republicans speak in holy terms about the \"sanctity\" of the \"temple of democracy\" being pillaged and ransacked, it is easy to be seduced into believing that this time will be different, that the perpetrators — from top to bottom — will be held to account. But doing so would buck a long-standing pillar of the bipartisan system: When it comes to the crimes of the powerful, we must always look forward.\n\nNo senior military official was prosecuted for the torture at the Abu Ghraib detention center in Iraq. No CIA officer went to jail, much less lost their job, for operating a global kidnapping and torture program. No one faced an indictment for the U.S. use of banned cluster bomb munitions in President Barack Obama's first airstrike in Yemen in December 2009 that shredded a few dozen human beings into ground meat. The failure to hold senior U.S. officials responsible for their crimes ensures that the crimes can and will continue. Look no further than the ascent of Gina Haspel, a key player in the CIA's torture program and the destruction of videotapes of the abuse of detainees, to become the first woman to head the agency. It was a fruit of Obama's look-forward-not-backward doctrine. There has rightly been outrage at Trump's pardons for soldiers and mercenaries convicted of war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the other side of that coin is the bipartisan refusal to prosecute the masterminds of U.S. imperial crimes in those countries or elsewhere.\n\nThe events of January 6 were shocking in only one way: the fact that a violent mob was able to so easily storm and occupy the Capitol. These events were unprecedented in that the most powerful political figure in the United States was the circus master who used incendiary language as he called on the mob to descend on the building. \"You'll never take back our country with weakness,\" Trump declared at a rally moments before the siege began. \"You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\" Trump's disgraced lawyer Rudy Giuliani went a step further, suggesting that the mob needed to create the conditions on Capitol Hill for a \"trial by combat.\"\n\nAmong the most serious questions as yet unresolved are: What role did law enforcement and Republican members of Congress play in facilitating the violent takeover of the Capitol? What did Trump administration officials in control of federal forces and the military know leading up to the siege? And did they facilitate it either directly or through deliberate inaction?\n\nNo one should pretend that this moment was not in some form predictable."}

In a recent interview with VOA Persian, Noronha said the department's USAdarFarsi (USA in Farsi) Instagram account grew its followers from 147,000 in January 2019 to 759,000 in January 2021, a more than five-fold increase in a two-year period.\n\nThe USAdarFarsi Facebook and Twitter channels also have more than 700,000 followers.\n\nNoronha said most engagement for the USAdarFarsi Instagram account comes from inside Iran where Instagram is the only major Western-run social media platform that Iranians can access freely. Facebook and Twitter are blocked by the Iranian government, leaving them accessible only to tech-savvy Iranians using virtual private networks.\n\nNoronha said VPNs, which hide a user's true location, make it hard for the State Department to determine how much traffic for its Persian Facebook and Twitter accounts comes from inside Iran versus from the Iranian diaspora. \"For the USAdarFarsi Twitter account, I'd say about half of our traffic comes from Iran and the other half from the U.S. and Europe,\" Noronha said. \"The Facebook account is somewhere between Twitter and Instagram (in terms of the amount of traffic that comes from Iran),\" he added.\n\nThe types of posts that got the most engagement on the USAdarFarsi accounts had three main themes, according to Noronha.\n\n\"Iranian social media users were most appreciative when we posted messages that supported their denunciations of the Iranian regime for imprisoning and executing rights activists, that endorsed their calls for anti-government protests and that celebrated Iranian cultural traditions pre-dating the nation's 1979 Islamic Revolution,\" he said. Iran's post-revolution clerical rulers have discouraged the observance of popular festivals and other cultural practices that they see as inconsistent with their fundamentalist view of Islam.\n\nNoronha said there was especially high traffic for Farsi-language tweets on Trump's personal Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, which Twitter permanently suspended earlier this month citing perceived incitement to violence, a move denounced by Trump as an attempt to silence his free speech.\n\nTrump tweeted in Farsi seven times during his presidential term, according to the Trump Twitter Archive, an online resource cited by U.S. news outlets. His first Farsi tweet, posted on February 11, 2019, got 65,000 likes and accused Iran's rulers of 40 years of corruption, repression, terror and failure as they marked the 40th anniversary of their revolution.\n\nTrump's second Farsi tweet posted on January 11, 2020 contained a message in support of Iranian street protests against the Iranian military's downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane shortly after it took off from Tehran three days earlier. It was the most popular of his seven Farsi tweets, drawing 340,000 likes. Trump's message said: \"To the brave and suffering people of Iran: I have stood with you since the beginning of my presidency and my government will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely. Your courage is inspiring.\"\n\nTrump's January 11, 2020 Farsi tweet angered Iran's then-Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi, who responded the next day by tweeting : \"Hands and tongues smeared with threatening, sanctioning and terrorizing the #Iranian nation, are not entitled to dishonor the ancient #Persian_language.\"\n\nTrump also drew large audiences for English-language tweets pressuring Iran. His five most-liked Iran tweets in English, with 317,000 to 713,000 likes, were posted in January 2020, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. In the tweets, he hinted that Iran would face strong retaliation for military strikes on U.S. targets, vowed it will never have a nuclear weapon and warned it not to kill antigovernment protesters.\n\nEarlier in his presidency, Trump also drew international attention for a November 2, 2018 tweet of an image or meme of himself superimposed with the message \"SANCTIONS ARE COMING\".\n\nThe text of the meme used a font popularized by American fantasy drama TV series Game of Thrones to highlight Trump's imminent restoration of U.S. sanctions against Iran after he withdrew earlier in the year from a 2015 deal in which world powers offered Iran sanctions relief in return for limits on its nuclear program. Trump said the deal did not do enough to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, a goal Tehran denies having.\n\nNazenin Ansari, managing editor of Iranian news websites Kayhan London and Kayhan Life, told VOA Persian the Trump administration's social media outreach to Iranians built on Farsi social media channels that were created under the previous administration of Barack Obama.\n\n\"The Trump administration's social media messaging on Iran checked all the boxes by highlighting the Iranian public's grievances with the malign policy choices of the Islamic Republic,\" she said."}

He said he would back U.S. Rep. Ted Budd over other Republicans seeking the party's nomination, an endorsement he made after his daughter-in-law, North Carolina native Lara Trump, confirmed to the crowd she would not run for the job herself.\n\nThe winner will replace one of Trump's frequent targets, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., one of the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict him for inciting the Jan. 6 riot. The full Senate acquitted Trump because prosecutors could not muster the two-thirds vote necessary for conviction.\n\nThe ex-president also used his North Carolina speech to defend his administration and attack its critics, including those in the media."}

It also studied whether political content from news organisations was amplified on Twitter, focusing primarily on US news sources such as Fox News, the New York Times and BuzzFeed.\n\nThe study compared Twitter's \"Home\" timeline – the default way its 200 million users are served tweets, in which an algorithm tailors what users see – with the traditional chronological timeline where the most recent tweets are ranked first.\n\nThe research found that in six out of seven countries, apart from Germany, tweets from rightwing politicians received more amplification from the algorithm than those from the left; right-leaning news organisations were more amplified than those on the left; and generally politicians' tweets were more amplified by an algorithmic timeline than by the chronological timeline.\n\nAccording to a 27-page research document, Twitter found a \"statistically significant difference favouring the political right wing\" in all the countries except Germany. Under the research, a value of 0% meant tweets reached the same number of users on the algorithm-tailored timeline as on its chronological counterpart, whereas a value of 100% meant tweets achieved double the reach. On this basis, the most powerful discrepancy between right and left was in Canada (Liberals 43%; Conservatives 167%), followed by the UK (Labour 112%; Conservatives 176%). Even excluding top government officials, the results were similar, the document said.\n\nTwitter said it wasn't clear why its Home timeline produced these results and indicated that it may now need to change its algorithm. A blog post by Rumman Chowdhury, Twitter's director of software engineering, and Luca Belli, a Twitter researcher, said the findings could be \"problematic\" and that more study needed to be done. The post acknowledged that it was concerning if certain tweets received preferential treatment not as a result of the way in which users interacted, but because of the inbuilt way the algorithm works.\n\n\"Algorithmic amplification is problematic if there is preferential treatment as a function of how the algorithm is constructed versus the interactions people have with it. Further root cause analysis is required in order to determine what, if any, changes are required to reduce adverse impacts by our Home timeline algorithm,\" the post said."}

Lindsey Graham said he's \"more determined than ever\" to strip away protections that make companies like Twitter immune to lawsuits.\n\nGraham said that's because of Twitter's decision Friday afternoon to ban President Donald Trump from its platform.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Graham said Twitter may ban him but he would \"willingly accept that fate.\"\n\n\"Your decision to permanently ban President Trump is a serious mistake,\" he said in a post. \"The Ayatollah can tweet, but Trump can't. Says a lot about the people who run Twitter.\"\n\nGraham said \"Big Tech\" are the only companies in the nation that have \"absolute immunity from being sued for their actions, and it's only because Congress gave them that protection.\"\n\n\"It's now time for Congress to repeal Section 230 and put Big Tech on the same legal footing as every other company in America,\" he tweeted. \"Legal accountability.\"\n\nTwitter announced it had banned Trump Friday over two tweets, including one in which the president stated he would not attend Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nThe first tweet stated, \"The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\"\n\nThe second read, \"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.\"\n\nThe platform claimed the second tweet \"may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a 'safe' target, as he will not be attending. It also claimed Trump's use of the words \"American Patriots\" to describe some of his supporters \"is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the U.S. Capitol.\"\n\nTwitter also claimed plans for future armed protests \"have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the U.S. Capitol and state capitol buildings\" on Jan. 17."}

Even during and after the election when Trump made claims of voter fraud, they labeled his posts rather than remove them.\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt blamed Trump for Wednesday's deadly events but also said the responsibility rested on the shoulders of the major tech companies.\n\n\"It's long overdue for Silicon Valley to step up and not just to temporarily take Trump off their platforms but to ban him permanently. He has used their products to incite an act of domestic terror in the heart of our government, in the temple of our democracy. This is a federal crime,\" Greenblatt told USA TODAY.\n\nHe said the companies were feeling the pressure.\n\n\"Freedom of expression is not the freedom to incite violence. That is not protected speech in any public place,\" Greenblatt said. \"And these are private businesses who can choose what customers they serve and don't serve.\"\n\nRep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, also called for permanent bans of Trump's accounts and said \"nothing short of that will meet this moment.\"\n\n\"For four years, Facebook and Twitter have given the President a platform to spew dangerous, violent lies and cause untold harm to our democracy.

But Beware the Downside\n\nAfter a shocking day in American history when a violent mob, incited by President Trump, stormed and breached the Capitol Building, Facebook and Twitter temporarily banned the president from using their platforms. On Thursday morning, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg went a step further, announcing Trump will be banned from Facebook's social media platforms until at least the end of his term on January 20.\n\nThe events were a direct reaction to words that Trump has repeated on social media, and that he said at a rally Wednesday before the attack on the Capitol—baseless claims about election fraud, the election being stolen from him, and his loss to Joe Biden in November.\n\n\"I think that banning [Trump's] account is the right call for social networks, but it might have unforeseen consequences,\" says Gianluca Stringhini, a Boston University College of Engineering assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering. He has been studying online disinformation, hate speech, and radicalization for years, and recently earned a National Science Foundation CAREER award to develop tools to rapidly identify coordinated cyber mobs.\n\nIn a recent paper, Stringhini and his collaborators studied what can unfold after radical online communities are banned from platforms. The researchers analyzed online posts made between 2017 and 2020 from r/The_Donald and r/Incels, two communities that were banned from Reddit and subsequently moved to stand-alone websites. They found overall that having them banned significantly decreased posting activity, reducing the number of posts, active users, and newcomers.\n\nBut r/The_Donald users that migrated to an independent website called thedonald.win showed signs of increased toxicity and radicalization. According to Stringhini, their findings paint a nuanced picture of the effect of platform moderation action and should help inform decisions that platforms, and government officials, make when it comes to dealing with false and hateful messages.\n\nThe Brink caught up with Stringhini to discuss Wednesday's events, and what impact a ban on Twitter and Facebook could have on Trump and his followers.\n\nQ & A With Gianluca Stringhini The Brink: Can you explain how Wednesday's events at the Capitol were fueled by online communities? Do you see a clear connection? Stringhini: In the past five years, my collaborators and I observed a tendency for people to move to polarized online communities where they could discuss their political—and often extreme—views without fearing censorship. We found that relatively small communities like 4chan's Politically Incorrect Board, Reddit's r/The_Donald subreddit, and websites Gab, Voat, and Parler became fertile grounds for conspiracy theories, disinformation, and online hate. This nefarious content then makes its way to mainstream social networks, where millions of users see it. Oftentimes, this migration of content from fringe communities to mainstream ones is facilitated by popular figures. For example, President Trump's Twitter account has posted conspiratorial and hateful content that first appeared in one of these small communities multiple times."}

The store was fully stocked, and more importantly, had functioning lights and heat. The fifty-year-old graphic designer found the same at the Food King store he visited afterward. Besides having to step over residual snow sludge on streets and sidewalks, El Pasoans like Gomez were experiencing few aftereffects of a historic winter storm that brought the city subfreezing temperatures and three inches of snow and ice.\n\nScrolling through Twitter that same day, Gomez found himself wishing he could do something to help when he saw pictures and videos of what so many fellow Texans were experiencing—bursting pipes, falling ceilings, flooding, and freezing homes. \"TEXAS! Head west, far west,\" he tweeted. \"Our grid is up in El Paso, and we welcome anyone that needs a respite from this frigid chaos. Hotels, shelters, and hope.\"\n\nWhen the winter storms that paralyzed most of Texas first blew through El Paso on February 14, only about 3,000 people in the city had a power outage in their homes, and more than 2,000 of those saw their power restored within just five minutes. No homes in this city of 682,000 residents spent days without power or heat—an experience common to millions throughout the rest of the state. Although this winter storm didn't hit El Paso as severely as it did other parts of the state, the conditions were similar to those during a February 2011 storm that devastated the city. It's thanks to the preparations that El Paso made in response to that disaster, as well as its operating on a different electric grid than the majority of Texas, that the city had a starkly different experience during the last awful week for the state.\n\nBecause of the vast distance that separates El Paso from Texas's other major population centers, and because its customer base includes parts of southern New Mexico, the power supply of the city's public utility isn't linked to the grid overseen by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages about 90 percent of the state's electric load. Instead, it's connected to the Western Interconnection grid, which spans fourteen states in the West, along with parts of Canada and Mexico. As a consequence, when the winter freeze hit Texas, El Paso Electric had a sizable safety net. In addition to its local plants, it drew on Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona to meet the surge in customer demand as people cranked up their thermostats.\n\nMeanwhile, ERCOT's grid purposefully remains within the state's boundaries in order to avoid federal energy regulations. When power it was counting on from wind, nuclear, and natural gas sources was adversely affected by the wintry conditions, ERCOT couldn't fall back on help from neighboring states. \"There's been a tremendous amount of supply disruptions,\" said Steve Buraczyk, El Paso Electric's senior vice president of operations. \"It's difficult for them to try to deal with that just within ERCOT.\"\n\nThe other big difference for El Paso Electric is that all of its power plants were outfitted for a deep freeze. After that February 2011 storm, hundreds of thousands of the utility's customers were left without power for extended periods. In the years since, it has spent millions to prepare for the next extreme winter event, including $4.5 million on adapting many of its existing facilities for prolonged operation in freezing temperatures. The winterization of a power plant is similar to preparing your house for winter, except much more expensive. Valves, transmitters, and pipelines, along with other areas of a plant that could be affected by freezing temperatures, have insulation added or heat lamps installed nearby."}

ERCOT manages the flow of electric power in the state.\n\n\"Traffic lights and other infrastructure may be temporarily without power,\" ERCOT said.\n\nA level-three emergency notice was issued by the regulator, urging customers to limit power usage and prevent an uncontrolled system-wide outage.\n\nThe storms knocked out nearly half the wind power generation capacity of Texas on Sunday.\n\nWind generation ranks as the second-largest source of electricity in Texas, accounting for 23 percent of state power supplies last year behind natural gas, which served 45 percent, ERCOT estimates.\n\nEnergy traders last week said that some five-minute power prices in Texas approached $4,000 per megawatt hour. That compares with an ERCOT North average of $26 in 2020.\n\nNationwide storm\n\nApart from Texas, much of the US from the Pacific Northwest through the Great Plains and into the mid-Atlantic states has been in the grip of bone-chilling weather over the weekend, featuring snow, sleet and freezing rain.\n\nAround 5,000 Oklahoma Gas & Electric customers were without power overnight, and Entergy Arkansas logged about 3,000 outages. Both states have much smaller populations than Texas.\n\nAccumulating ice between 0.25 and 0.6cm (a tenth and a quarter of an inch) was possible across eastern Louisiana, Mississippi, central Tennessee, Kentucky and over into the West Virginia and Ohio border region, said National Weather Service (NWS) lead forecaster Bob Oravec.\n\nUp to 30cm (12 inches) of snow was expected across parts of the southern Plains into Monday, said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the NWS's Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThe region had been gearing up for the winter weather for the better part of the weekend. Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration on February 12 for all of the state's 254 counties.\n\nA deadly pileup due to icy roads killed six that day in Forth Worth.\n\nAbbott, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson each activated National Guard units to assist state agencies with tasks including rescuing stranded drivers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also declared an emergency in Texas in a statement Sunday night. The declaration is intended to add federal aid to state and local response efforts.\n\nThe extreme weather is expected to continue. The NWS said Sunday that the forecast through early Tuesday calls for 20 to 30cm (8 to 12 inches) of snow in central Oklahoma, and 10 to 20cm (4 to 8 inches) in an area extending from eastern Texas to the Ohio Valley in the Northeast."}

Ted Cruz said his family vacation to Mexico was \"obviously a mistake\" as he returned stateside Thursday following an uproar over his disappearance during a deadly winter storm.\n\nThe Republican senator said he began second-guessing the trip since the moment he first got on the plane Wednesday. \"In hindsight, I wouldn't have done it,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe Associated Press and other media outlets reported that he had traveled out of the country with his family as hundreds of thousands of Texans were still grappling with the fallout of a winter storm that crippled the state's power grid. The trip drew criticism from leaders in both parties and was seen as potentially damaging to his future political ambitions.\n\nCruz said in an earlier statement Thursday that he accompanied his family to Cancun a day earlier after his daughters asked to go on a trip with friends, given that school was canceled for the week.\n\n\"Wanting to be a good dad, I flew down with them last night and am flying back this afternoon,\" Cruz wrote.\n\n\"My staff and I are in constant communication with state and local leaders to get to the bottom of what happened in Texas,\" he continued. \"We want our power back, our water on, and our homes warm.\"\n\nCruz told reporters Thursday night that he returned to the U.S. because he realized he needed to be in Texas. He said he had originally been scheduled to stay in Mexico through the weekend.\n\n\"I didn't want all the screaming and yelling about this trip to distract even one moment from the real issues that I think Texans care about, which is keeping all of our families safe,\" Cruz said.\n\n\"It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn't have done it,\" he said.\n\nThe fierce political backlash comes as Cruz eyes a second presidential run in 2024. He was already one of the most villainized Republicans in Congress, having created adversaries across the political spectrum in a career defined by far-right policies and fights with the establishment.\n\nMore recently, he emerged as a leader in former President Donald Trump's push to overturn the results of the November election. Billboards calling for his resignation stood along Texas highways earlier in the month.\n\nEven the state Republican Party chair declined to come to Cruz's defense on Thursday.\n\n\"That's something that he has to answer to his constituents about,\" Texas GOP Chair Allen West said when asked whether Cruz's travel was appropriate while Texans are without power and water.\n\n\"I'm here trying to take care of my family and look after my friends and others that are still without power,\" West said. \"That's my focus.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of people in Texas woke up Thursday to a fourth day without power, and a water crisis was unfolding after winter storms wreaked havoc on the state's power grid and utilities.\n\nTexas officials ordered 7 million people — one-quarter of the population of the nation's second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking the water, after days of record low temperatures that damaged infrastructure and froze pipes.\n\nIn Austin, some hospitals faced a loss in water pressure and, in some cases, heat.\n\nNews of Cruz's absence quickly rippled across the state.\n\nLivia Trevino, a 24-year-old whose Austin home was still without water Thursday, said she felt abandoned by government leaders.\n\n\"They are taking vacations and leaving the country, so they don't have to deal with this, and we are freezing to death. We don't have water and we don't have food,\" she said.\n\nIn his statement, Cruz said that his family had lost heat and power as well.\n\n\"This has been an infuriating week for Texans,\" he said.\n\nWhile the situation will not help Cruz's political future, the two-term senator is not in any immediate political danger. His current term expires in early 2025, and the unofficial beginning of the next Republican presidential primary election is two years away.\n\nStill, Democrats across Washington were eager to talk about the controversy.\n\nOne of Cruz's most aggressive critics on the left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, encouraged her supporters on Thursday to volunteer for a \"welfare check phone bank\" to help Texans affected by the storm.\n\n\"So many elected leaders in Texas have failed their constituents,\" the New York Democrat wrote in an email. \"Instead of focusing on relief, they've chosen to go on Fox News to spread lies or to board a plane to Cancun.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, White House press secretary Jen Psaki leaned into a question about Cruz's \"whereabouts.\"\n\n\"I don't have any updates on the exact location of Sen. Ted Cruz nor does anyone at the White House,\" Psaki said, adding that President Joe Biden's administration is focused on \"working directly with leadership in Texas and surrounding states on addressing the winter storm and the crisis at hand.\"\n\nCruz's office declined to answer specific questions about the family vacation, but his staff reached out to the Houston Police Department on Wednesday afternoon to say the senator would be arriving at the airport, according to department spokesperson Jodi Silva. She said officers \"monitored his movements\" while Cruz was at the airport.\n\nSilva could not say whether such requests are typical for Cruz's travel or whether his staff had made a similar request for his return flight.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police officials and the Senate sergeant-at-arms have encouraged lawmakers and their staff to be conscious of potential threats and to consider advising law enforcement about their travel at airports and other transportation hubs.\n\nCruz's office did not immediately say whether the senator would self-quarantine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people who have traveled during the pandemic to get a coronavirus test three to five days after their return and to quarantine for a full week, regardless of the test results.\n\nCruz checked in for his return flight Thursday afternoon in Cancun and walked briskly through the terminal pulling a roller bag to security. He wore a golf shirt, jeans and a face mask in the style of the Texas state flag.\n\nThe senator was accompanied by a Spanish-speaking man wearing a black polo shirt with the name and logo of The Ritz-Carlton hotel chain.\n\nCruz told reporters that he planned to \"go home and keep working to get the grid reopened, to get power restored, to get the water back on.\""}

The report found the freezing accounted for 44% of the issues, followed by natural gas fuel shortage issues, which accounted for 31% of the unplanned outages.\n\nThe findings show that most natural gas production and processing facilities at Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) \"were not identified as critical load or otherwise protected from load shedding\" and ultimately led to a decline in natural gas production and supply.\n\nThe federal agency offered 28 recommendations, most of which should occur within the next two to three years.\n\nThe recommendations include winterizing equipment and conducting annual training on winterization plans. Generator owners who experience outages or failures due to freezing should review what occurred and implement corrective action plans.\n\nA similar report with recommendations was released after the blackouts in 2011. Most power providers did not act on them. A decade later, experts say the recommendations need to be taken seriously.\n\n\"We need to listen this time.

Tuesday was the coldest day in North Texas in 72 years, with the Dallas-Fort Worth area reaching a record low temperature of minus 2 degrees Fahrenheit this week.\n\nThe cold weather has triggered a wave of blackouts across Texas, leaving millions of residents shivering in the dark. In some places, Texans have been without power for days.\n\nPublic officials and utility customers want to know why the Texas power grid wasn't better prepared. And to get ahead of the next extreme event like this, it's also important to ask what the chances are of something like this happening again.\n\nWith average temperatures rising around the world due to greenhouse gas emissions, there is more heat in the global climate system. That's already having some predictable impacts, like an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves.\n\nBut it may be having some counterintuitive effects as well, especially during colder seasons. How climate change will reshape winters is, as scientists like to say, an area of active research.\n\nThere are a couple of competing ideas for how more warming will change the likelihood of extreme cold periods, like the frigid weather currently gripping much of the US. One group of researchers says that warming will make such events less likely, while another says that warming in the Arctic will increase the chances of frigid polar air spilling further south, leading to more periods of extreme cold in the near term.\n\n\"I would say it's still pretty controversial and it has been for quite a while,\" said Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nBut as Texas shows, failing to prepare for winter weather extremes can be devastating, so it's critical to find out what scenarios could be in store and how often they'll occur.\n\nHow an episode of warming in the stratosphere above the Arctic led to a chill in Texas\n\nJust like heat waves in the summer, a prolonged drop in temperature in the winter is a distinct meteorological phenomenon. The American Meteorological Society defines a \"cold wave\" as \"a rapid fall in temperature within 24 hours to temperatures requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities.\"\n\nAnd like heat waves, what counts as a cold wave depends on the local climate. The temperature threshold for a cold snap in Alaska is much lower than that for Arkansas."}

With no power, her apartment was dangerously cold and the family pulled on several pairs of pants and sweaters to keep warm.\n\nBenitez's power and water returned Thursday, just as her fridge and cupboards grew bare. But now a new struggle begins: The storm kept her from cleaning homes all week and, as her family's sole wage earner, she's instantly behind on rent and utilities. Grocery donations from friends have helped. But those will run out soon.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who are still struggling,\" Benitez, 51, said. \"There are a lot of people who don't have enough to eat, who don't have enough blankets. This is not over.\"\n\nAs millions of Texans grapple with the aftermath of a deadly winter storm, people of color and low-income communities who were disproportionately affected by blackouts and burst pipes could now face the hardest journey to recovery, experts said.\n\nThe historic winter weather exacerbated pre-existing disparities like poor infrastructure and lack of resources in marginalized communities. Black and Latino communities who were disproportionately hit by COVID-19 now must struggle to recover from one of the worst weather events to ever hit Texas. And previous disaster response failures indicate the situation may get worse as the state thaws out.\n\n\"What you will see, as with COVID-19 and with any disaster, is disproportionate death and negative impacts for those who are most vulnerable among us,\" said Chauncia Willis, chief executive of the Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management, an Atlanta-based non-profit focused on emergency management and racial justice. \"These inequities are easily identifiable before disaster and, of course, they're rooted in systemic bias, racism and the country's anti-poverty mindset.\"\n\nLower-income families may not be able to stock up on essentials ahead of the storm, have access to transportation in the event of an emergency or afford precautions like renters or flood insurance, leaving them vulnerable when disaster strikes, Willis said.\n\nPower outages numbered about 139,000 in Texas by Friday, down from a high of 4 million earlier in the week. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has deployed generators, blankets and pallets of bottled water to Texans. Meanwhile, advocacy groups have been sheltering those in need and delivering meals and groceries to families who still can't find food, as grocery stores struggle to restock.\n\nThe Austin Justice Coalition delivered food to more than 40 families around Austin who had run out of food, said João Paulo Connolly, the group's director of housing and community development. Around 90% of those families were Black or Latino, he said.\n\nThe storm hit families of all races and ethnicities and knocked out power even in affluent neighborhoods, Connolly said. But families of color in lower-income areas often don't have a car or the funds to hunt for groceries or make quick repairs on busted pipes, he said. Thus, it'll take them longer to recover from the disaster, he said.\n\n\"Everyone's out of food and having a hard time getting to the store,\" Connolly said. \"It's just a general mess.\"\n\nIn Houston, the frigid temperatures and outages created a citywide water crisis. As power gets restored and drinkable water returns to homes, county officials are studying how best to help residents and use federal funds to restore neighborhoods.\n\nCounty Commissioner Rodney Ellis, whose district is 70% Black and Hispanic, said he hopes communities of color get equitable disaster relief. During the disaster response following 2017's Hurricane Harvey, which flooded most of Houston, more affluent communities often benefited more from federal disaster funds than communities of color -- something he'd like to reverse following this event, he said.\n\n\"Often time in government, we don't do things with that equity lens,\" he said. \"I'm worried about communities of color being disproportionately impacted.\"\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas directed utility companies to implement outages to compensate for the increased demand in electricity and disrupted supply, according to Varun Rai, director of the University of Texas-Austin's Energy Institute.\n\nUtility companies prioritized keeping the power on in downtown areas that include critical service providers such as hospitals and nursing homes, which benefited residents in the typically densely populated, wealthier neighborhoods nearby, he said.\n\nLower-income families typically live farther from these areas, meaning they were less likely to have power during planned outages, Rai said.\n\n\"Even when you're not in emergency situations, like we are today, it takes much longer and it's much harder for many communities to get access,\" he said.\n\nThis stark contrast was highlighted in photos taken in Austin that show the downtown area glaringly bright while hundreds of thousands of homes, particularly in East Austin, the city's historically Black and Hispanic neighborhood, were without power.\n\nThe increased demand for electricity will likely mean electric bills will go up, Rai said, another blow to lower-income households that already spend a higher percentage of their income on utilities.\n\nAlthough electricity is back on for many Texans, the crisis is not over due to the lack of safe drinking water in many areas. Seven million Texans must boil their tap water before drinking it because record low temperatures damaged infrastructure and pipes."}

The cost may be included on Texans' gas bills for up to the next 30 years.\n\nThe move, approved unanimously by the three Railroad Commission members, was the most recent step in a process state legislators approved last spring known as \"securitization.\" It essentially turned blackout-related debt owed to natural gas companies and others into low-interest bonds guaranteed by the state.\n\nThose bonds are then paid back over decades by charging higher bills to consumers. The Railroad Commission vote today approved the issuance of those bonds by another state group, the Texas Public Finance Authority.\n\nDuring the winter storm, tight gas supply and high demand translated into historic high prices as utilities struggled to bring gas to residential customers and electric companies scrambled to secure fuel for their power plants.\n\nAt times, gas traded 150 times higher than it had before the crisis.\n\nThose prices made massive profits for gas companies,estimated at $11 billion earlier this year by Bloomberg News. They also led to accusations of price gouging, which would have been illegal if it had been been applied to other products like gasoline.\n\n\"It would be like you're going to fill up your gas tank during the storm ... and instead of paying $50-ish to fill up your tank, the register there reads: 'Give me $6,000 to $7,000,'\" Paula Gold-Williams, former head of San Antonio's publicly owned utility, told KUT in July.\n\nTexas' regulated gas distribution utilities, which don't make money from higher fuel costs, typically pass those costs on to consumers. For those utilities and their ratepayers, securitization was pitched as a way to spread out the pain of paying the massive price tag of the blackout.\n\nWhile the Railroad Commission approved the securitization of $3.4 billion, it remains unclear exactly how much individual ratepayers will see their monthly bills increase and when.\n\nTexas Gas Service, which services the Austin area and is the state's third largest gas distributor, says it doesn't know yet what the impact on customers' bills will be.\n\n\"The Railroad Commission has 90 days to issue a financing order which instructs the Texas Public Finance Authority to issue bonds,\" Texas Gas Service said in an email. \"After that, the Texas Public Finance Authority has 180 days to issue the bonds. As this process unfolds, the length of time for recovery and the rate charged to customers will be determined.\"\n\nIn a legislative hearing after the storm, Texas Gas Service told lawmakers that it paid 22 times more than usual for gas during the freeze and blackout.\n\nOne estimate published by the Austin Monitor in August said Texas Gas Service bills may increase by $5 a month for the next 10 years.\n\nAfter Wednesday's vote, critics accused state lawmakers and the Railroad Commission of putting gas company profits over customer needs."}

The Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities across 14 states, called for rolling outages because the supply of reserve energy had been exhausted. Some utilities said they were starting blackouts, while others urged customers to reduce power usage.\n\n\"We're living through a really historic event going on right now,\" said Jason Furtado, a professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, pointing to all of Texas under a winter storm warning and the extent of the freezing temperatures.\n\nIn Houston, where county leaders had warned that the freeze could create problems on the scale of massive hurricanes that slam the Gulf Coast, one electric provider said power may not be restored to some homes until Tuesday.\n\n\"This weather event, it's really unprecedented. We all living here know that,\" said Dan Woodfin, senior director of system operations at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. He defended preparations made by grid operators and described the demand on the system as record-setting.\n\n\"This event was well beyond the design parameters for a typical, or even an extreme, Texas winter that you would normally plan for. And so that is really the result that we're seeing,\" Woodfin said.\n\nThe largest grocery store chain in Texas, H-E-B, closed locations around Austin and San Antonio, cities that are unaccustomed to snow and have little resources to clear roads.

More than half (52%) pointed to \"policymaking failures by Texas lawmakers.\"\n\nThe poll, led by researchers from the Texas Politics Project and the UT Energy Institute, was conducted online among 1,200 self-declared registered voters in Texas from March 19 to 26. The overall results have a margin of error of +/- 2.83 percentage points.\n\n\"Texans have a lot of ideas about what contributed to the hardships that a majority of them experienced to one degree or another,\" said James Henson, executive director of the Texas Politics Project and one of the lead researchers on the poll. \"The flurry of activity we see in the Texas Legislature suggests that lawmakers know their constituents were affected by the infrastructure failures that took place during and after the storm and want meaningful action.\"\n\nLooking forward, 85% of Texas voters say they support requiring energy providers to weatherize their facilities, though a smaller share, 53%, favor providing government funds to pay for weatherization. Other proposals that received substantial support included requiring that companies and regulators ensure higher levels of reserve energy to meet spikes in demand (78%), requiring all Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) board members to reside in Texas (75%), and creating a statewide disaster alert system for impending weather-related disasters and power outages (73%).\n\nThe poll also asked Texans to reflect on their experiences during the storm and in its aftermath:\n\n66% of those polled reported their electricity stopped working during the storm.\n\nOf those who reported electricity outages, 49% reported being without electricity for one to three days, and 28% without power between four and seven days.\n\n56% reported not having reliable internet access in their home.\n\n53% reported having to obtain drinking water.\n\n30% reported lost income from not being able to go to work.\n\n40% reported an electricity bill that was higher than normal.\n\nIt also explored Texans' assessments of how various entities and actors handled the storm and its effects:\n\n8% approved of how ERCOT handled the response to the storm, 72% disapproved.\n\n12% approved of how the Public Utility Commission handled the response to the storm, 50% disapproved.\n\n12% approved of how the Railroad Commission of Texas handled the response to the storm, 47% disapproved.\n\nThe state's political leadership received mixed reviews for their handling of the storm and its effects. Gov. Greg Abbott received approving marks from 41% of Texas voters while 45% disapproved — higher than the 28% of voters who approved of how the Texas Legislature has handled the situation, with 37% disapproving.

Magness will soon depart ERCOT following a 60-day termination notice handed to him by ERCOT's board of directors in March.\n\nIn the weeks since the winter storm, both ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the regulatory body that oversees it, have been lambasted for failures in preparing for and responding to the storm.\n\nERCOT underestimated the maximum amount of power that would be demanded by homes, businesses and industry during a severe winter storm in its fall projections, and it overestimated the amount of power generation that would be available to the grid during such a storm.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick had called for Magness and DeAnn Walker, then the head of the PUC, to resign. While Magness was fired, Walker resigned after also coming under harsh criticism from lawmakers. Gov. Greg Abbott called for reforming the governance of ERCOT, and legislation to do so is advancing through the Legislature.\n\nBut after recent leadership shakeups at ERCOT and the PUC, it is state lawmakers who are now increasingly coming under pressure to pass substantial legislation that would protect the state from another power failure the next time inclement weather hits Texas.\n\nAn immediate concern Jones must confront at ERCOT is the prospect of an atypical summer that pushes demand for electricity beyond normal summer peaks. Texas is likely to see a hotter and drier summer than normal this year, according to an April climate outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and 2021 is likely to rank among the 10 warmest years on record globally."}

But winter storm-related supply chain shortages are different than those consumers experienced during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt's a matter of supply and demand, said David Anderson, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service economist, Bryan-College Station.\n\n\"This is not another COVID situation from last March,\" Anderson said. \"This is a really harsh winter storm. Of course, the effects have been exacerbated by the electric grid and water problems.\"\n\nHe explained that snow and ice storms, as well as other weather events, can and do cause food production problems, both short- and long-term.\n\nMany AgriLife Extension agents and specialists, as well as other government officials, are assessing damages this week and turning those reports in for a state assessment of expected losses and economic impacts. Some impacts can be seen immediately, while others, especially on crops subjected to freezing temperatures for extended periods, need some time to materialize once the snow and ice have melted away.\n\n\"If a cattle packing plant is shut down, then beef production will be lower one week but back up the next,\" he said. \"Also, these weather events may destroy crops like vegetables or fruit. If they do, then we'll have tighter supplies and higher prices until the next production can occur either from another region of the world or part of the U.S. If the storm killed a lot of chickens, then we might have lower production for a few months and higher prices.\"\n\nSo, while this is a transportation and supply chain issue again, it is one that will be mostly short in nature. What occurred last week and through the weekend in the stores is the result of understandable occurrences, Anderson said. With a little more time to resupply shelves, things should soon be back to normal, he said, as it's not a food production problem.\n\n\"In extreme events like this people go to the store and buy a lot of stuff to get through the event,\" he said. \"Then, during the event, the trucks to resupply the shelves can't get through, so there is nothing there. And all the folks working to refill the shelves were also affected by the storm — their homes faced the same problem, they have trouble getting to work, and the trucks can't move until the storm passes.\"\n\nHowever, Anderson said, this situation was a consumer issue as well – one seen during the early stages of the pandemic. In addition to overcoming the urge to overbuy on some items, consumers had to learn to be flexible in their choices until things returned to normal.\n\n\"I can't help but think there is some demand side to this too,\" he said. \"All of us consumers rush out to buy stuff, overwhelming the system. That's fine. You need to get stocked up for not being able to go out. But I think also we could probably all use some flexibility. We expect the shelves to be full no matter what. We expect to be able to get whatever we want, whenever we want it, regardless of season. I think some flexibility, planning and patience would help us all.\""}

The study found 89% of those polled in Harris County said they lost electrical power, compared to 71% of Texans overall. When asked what was the most serious problem faced in Harris County during the storm, 74% considered power loss the most serious issue, with loss of running water in a close second at 71%.\n\nThroughout the storm, Harris County residents lost an average of 49 hours of power. Houston's main energy provider, CenterPoint, was unable to provide sustainable rolling power outages. As a result, three-quarters of Harris County survey participants said there should be developments in other energy sources, such as wind and solar, to protect the country's energy supply.\n\n\"When it comes to supporting proposed policy changes aimed at protecting people and infrastructure from severe weather, an overwhelming majority of Harris County residents think it's a good idea, but the challenge comes with how to fund those improvements,\" wroteRenée Cross, senior director at the Hobby School.\n\nWith a majority of Harris County left without power, residents were forced to turn to alternative methods of keeping their homes warm. Among those who stayed in their homes without power, 34% used a natural gas oven or cooktop to keep warm.\n\nOftentimes, Harris County residents put their own health at risk: 9% of residents surveyed used a grill or smoker indoors, while 8% used an outdoor propane heater indoors, despite the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nSurvey respondents said storm preparedness was lacking, showing an overwhelming 79% of participants who did not agree power cuts were distributed in an equitable manner.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas received a 78% disapproval rating, the highest disapproval percentage calculated, followed by Gov.

The initial manner of death has been ruled a homicide but the cause of death remains pending final autopsy results, it said.\n\nBrent Blue, the Teton County Coroner, performed the autopsy on Tuesday after investigators discovered the body in a camping area within Grand Teton National Park.

After speaking with the couple, officers classified it as a \"mental health break.\"\n\nIn a police report, one officer wrote that Petito, Laundrie and a witness all said Petito slapped Laundrie after an argument, and Laundrie then \"grabbed her face and pushed her back.\" The officer said neither Petito nor Laundrie wanted to press charges.\n\nPetito's last known contact with family was in late August while she was in Grand Teton National Park, authorities said. She was reported missing on September 11 — 10 days after Laundrie returned home from the trip without her.\n\n\"(The) first word that popped in my brain was 'coward,' to be honest with you,\" Petito's friend, Rose Davis, told CBS News. \"You're supposed to love her.

Petito and Laundrie were childhood sweethearts who met while growing up on Long Island, New York. His parents later moved to North Port, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Sarasota.\n\nThe couple's trek in the Ford Transit van began in July from Long Island. They intended to reach Oregon by the end of October, according to their social media accounts, but Petito vanished after her last known contact with family in late August from Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, authorities said.\n\nPolice video released by the Moab Police Department in Utah showed that an officer pulled the van over on Aug. 12 after it was seen speeding and hitting a curb near the entrance to Arches National Park. The body cam video showed an emotional Petito, who sat inside a police cruiser while officers also questioned Laundrie."}

But I wish missing women of color got this much attention\n\nThe apparent murder of 22-year-old Gabby Petito has been a consistent part of the American news cycle since she disappeared on 11 September. Her YouTube presence and participation in the Instagram #vanlife subculture, which involves young people travelling around the country living aesthetically appealing lives in vans and converted buses, provided plenty of content for internet detectives on sites like TikTok and Reddit to consume. Her story is heart-wrenching, especially after police footage has emerged of Petito and her fiance, Brian Laundrie, who is now a \"person of interest\" in her death, having a domestic crisis.\n\nBut the story also feels eerily familiar – so familiar, in fact, that there is a term for it: \"missing white woman syndrome\". White women, particularly conventionally attractive middle- or upper-class white women, tend to receive disproportionate media coverage when they go missing. Petito's case is tragic, but the media attention it has attracted replicates a systemic pattern.\n\nGabby Petito deserves justice; there is no doubt about that. Her death was ruled a homicide by a Wyoming coroner on 21 September, a few days after her body was discovered. She'd been missing for weeks after a roadtrip with her fiance, who returned from the trip without her and soon went missing himself. Her story quickly went viral on social media outlets: a Reddit forum created to track her case has accumulated more than 119,000 members at time of writing, and TikTok videos featuring her have received over 200m views.\n\nIt is concerning when policy priorities are so clearly weighted toward victims of certain racial identities and social classes\n\nThe media joined in this explosion of attention, and public officials soon followed. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, declared online that he has directed all state agencies to assist with the search for Laundrie, who is on the run. I hope they catch him. According to 2019 numbers, however, there are well over a thousand other missing persons in Florida alone. Media attention influences how politicians and law enforcement agencies allocate resources, and it is concerning when policy priorities are so clearly weighted toward victims of certain racial identities and social classes."}

(Video: Reuters)\n\nBut the heavy coverage of her story has reignited a long-standing debate about whether the American media disproportionately covers tragedies involving young White women while largely ignoring the plights of missing women of color, who do not regularly generate national coverage.\n\nMSNBC host Joy Reid criticized her own industry Monday on her prime-time show, calling the Petito coverage an example of \"missing White woman syndrome,\" a term coined by the late journalist Gwen Ifill. \"Why not the same media attention when people of color go missing?\" asked Reid, who is Black, before echoing a guest's suggestion that a structural bias in the news business could be at play.\n\n\"If the woman who is missing looks like your own daughter or granddaughter, and you're a newsroom executive, you're going to gravitate more toward it,\" Reid said. \"If this is the way that these [other] young women look, maybe they're not noticed as much. But we need to change that.\"\n\nLynnette Grey Bull, the founder of a Wyoming-based group focused on advocating for missing and trafficked Native Americans, appeared on Reid's show to make a case for more proportional media coverage. \"Unfortunately, us here that live on the reservation, we kind of just adopted an understanding that if we don't have blond hair and blue eyes, we aren't prime-time material,\" she told The Washington Post in an interview."}

This was her dream,\" Schmidt said.\n\nPetito's parents said the couple documented every step of the way, spending time in Colorado and southern Utah.\n\n\"If you look at her Instagram page, you can actually find a lot of evidence of where they were these past few months,\" said Schmidt.\n\nSchmidt pointed to her daughter's Instagram account with posts at Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, and Mystic Hot Springs in Monroe\n\nBut toward the end of August, the posts started slowing down.\n\nPetito's father, who lives in Florida, said the couple was in Salt Lake City on Aug. 21. He knows because he placed an Uber Eats order for them.\n\n\"There was a power outage. She said she didn't have WiFi, so I ordered her some food,\" Joseph Petito said. \"I know it was in Salt Lake City. It was the last time I spoke to her.\"\n\nHe said the couple didn't have friends in Salt Lake City but wanted to spend time in the area.\n\nGabby Petito's parents said the couple left Salt Lake City for Grand Teton National Park around Aug. 24, where they believe the couple spent no more than two days.\n\nThis was also around the last time Petito spoke with her mother over FaceTime.\n\n\"She seemed OK to me at the time, other than I don't know where the relationship was going with the boyfriend,\" said Schmidt of the couple possibly going through a rough patch.\n\nThen the details get hazy as Petito's parents say they're not sure if she made it to her next destination.\n\n\"She was making her way up to Yellowstone,\" Schmidt said explaining that after Aug. 24 her communication with Petito grew sporadic and happened only via text.\n\n\"The last text I got from her was on Aug. 30. I don't know if that was her texting me or not,\" Schmidt said.\n\nThen Petito stopped responding all together. Schmidt said she initially figured the couple had lost internet reception but late last week, her mother knew something was off.\n\nPetito's parents said they started reaching out to their local law enforcement agencies in Florida and New York. On Saturday evening, Schmidt said a detective at the Suffolk County Police Department agreed to file a case.\n\nIn an email, the Suffolk County Police Department confirmed the van was located but did not specify where. In a press release, the van was described as a white 2012 Ford Transit van with Florida license plate QFTG03.\n\nThey also declined to provide information on Petito's boyfriend or his current whereabouts.\n\nA department spokesperson also said the department does not comment on suspects or persons of interest adding, \"We are not commenting on who has been spoken to in relation to this investigation.\"\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS, or they can submit an online tip through P3tips.com.\n\nPetito was described as approximately 5-foot-5, weighing 110 pounds.

An autopsy is being conducted.\n\nBrian Laundrie remains missing. A search for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve in Florida has been suspended.\n\nUWO student Miranda Baker took to TikTok to say she and her boyfriend picked up a hitchhiker at Grand Teton National Park on August 29. She says that hitchhiker was Brian Laundrie. They called authorities.\n\n\"He got out and he was thankful and he was kind of in a hurry. So he said he was going to go across the street into the parking lot and find someone else to give him a ride. But when we looked back 10 or 15 seconds after he got out of the vehicle, he was gone,\" Baker told Good Morning America.\n\nThe case has been the source of nationwide intrigue. Laundrie and Petito were on a cross-country van trip and detailing their journey on social media prior to Petito's disappearance. Petito's family last heard from the 22-year-old on Aug. 25. That's when the last photos of the couple together were posted on social media. They were camping at Grand Teton.\n\nIt was Aug. 29 when Miranda Baker and her boyfriend picked up the hitchhiker who they say was Laundrie.\n\n\"On Aug. 29, my boyfriend and I picked up Brian at Grand Teton National Park at 5:30 at night at Colter Bay. I'm hoping this can help someone identify him because I saw him from TikTok, which made me call the authorities and my boyfriend and I have been in contact with a bunch of different people to help piece together different parts of this case,\" Baker says in a TikTok posted three days ago.\n\n\"He approached us asking us for a ride because he needed to go to Jackson, which we were going to Jackson that night. I said hop in. He hops in the back of my Jeep. We then proceeded to make small talk. Before he came into the car he offered to pay us like, $200 to give him a ride, like 10 miles. So that was kind of weird. He then told us he's been camping for multiple days without his fiancée. He did say he had a fiancée, and that she was working on their social media page back at their van. In conversation, I brought up that we're going to Jackson. He freaked out. He's like 'nope, I need to get out right now, you know, pull over.' So we pulled over at the Jackson Dam. It's not very far from Colter Bay.\"\n\nBaker said Laundrie \"had scruff, but didn't look dirty.\" She found that strange because he said he had been camping.\n\nShe says they dropped Laundrie off at 6:09 p.m. on Aug. 29. He told them he was going to find someone else to hitch a ride.\n\nBaker did another video mapping out the area where they picked up Laundrie.\n\nSeveral days later, on Sept. 1, Laundrie returned home to North Port, Florida. He and Gabby lived with his parents there.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Petito's family reported her missing. Laundrie chose not to cooperate with authorities.\n\nOn Sept. 17, police and the FBI announce that Laundrie is missing and his family saw him three days prior to that date.\n\nOn Sept. 19, searchers find the body of a woman in northern Wyoming. They believe it to be Gabby Petito.\n\nBrian Laundrie has been called a person of interest in the case."}
