A majority of her customers are members of the LGBTQ community and she is currently in litigation with the Colorado Attorney General to ensure that she and her business can carry on serving members of the community without fear of being shut down.Lorie Smith said she would do so if the Court rules for her in a lawsuit against the Attorney General's office, the Denver Post reported.In the case of 303 Creative v. Elenis, the issue is whether a wedding catering company has a right to refuse service to LGBTQ couples on the grounds that it is discriminating against them because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. If the court sides with the company, the plaintiff, Elenis, may be able to sue the caterer for refusing to serve her at the wedding. The plaintiff's attorneys argued that if the caterer took Elenis's order and she refused to serve her at the wedding, she would be discriminating against her. The company, on the other hand, argued that refusing to honor Elenis's request would be \"illegal discrimination\" on the grounds of sexual orientation, meaning that it could face lawsuits from gay couples who want their caterer to serve them, the Washington Blade reported. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in March and the final result is still in question. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case in September, Lambda Legal's Jennifer Pizer said, adding that she was concerned about the potential for widespread discrimination if the court rules in favor of 303 Creative."}

And that a president who unrelentingly exploits societal divisions and abuses the rule of law cannot stay in office. The nation is now divided. The GOP is divided and the Trump presidency is divided. That's why, as the nation faces its greatest crisis in four years, we must hold Donald Trump accountable. This is the year when America will experience the most divisive presidential election in a decade. And if Trump loses, then he will be responsible for that. President Trump should be impeached for inciting a riot that saw five die and the speaker of the House of Representatives and a senior House Democrat were assaulted. It's time to end Trump's dangerous presidency and move on. It's been nearly two years since the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, a violent protest against the election result led by Donald Trump supporters. As the nation prepares to cast its ballots on Nov. 3, 2020, we look back at the history of the riots that led to Trump's impeachment and at why impeachment is needed. Trump tweeted that he would \"walk out of the White House\" after being impeached, but that was not the case. In the weeks that followed, Trump continued to claim his innocence, insisting that he was being unfairly slandered. He also tweeted a series of tweets that stated that there would be chaos during the election on Nov. 3 if he were to lose. In light of the riots on January 6, Trump tweeted on Jan. 20 that \"there will be NO violence whatsoever\" at the polls. Since then, Trump has said that he won the election and that \"we were the ones who started the riots.\" He even tweeted that his supporters will \"take\" the election if he loses. After the riots on January 6, a number of Trump supporters took to social media to share their thoughts about the riots, the president, and the future of the country. Below is a selection of those tweets: After Trump supporters rioted on January 6 at the U.S. Capitol, the House impeached Trump on Wednesday on charges of inciting the riot, which led to the death of a Capitol Police officer. Donald Trump was charged with inciting the riot, which led to the death of a Capitol Police officer.

The Department of Homeland Security is leading the probe into National Park Service's response to the storming of the Capitol building. That agency also has an office of inspector general that will lead a separate inquiry into the Park Service's role before and during the Jan. 6 riot. The National Park Service (NPS) is a part of the Interior Department, which includes the National Park Service and the U.S. Park Police, which are responsible for the safety of national parks, monuments, and historical sites. After several days of intense speculation and reports from the media that the investigation had been delayed or dropped, the Interior Department said Monday that a preliminary investigation has begun. It will be conducted by the Department of Interior's office of inspector general, the department said in a written statement. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the U.S. Park Police and National Park Service were responsible for securing the grounds of the Capitol on Jan. 6. \"It was our responsibility,\" he said, \"to keep people safe.\" U.S. Park Police Chief Pat McCoy told USA TODAY late last week that the police did not know that the National Park Service had been preparing security for the inauguration. McCoy said the police were working with NPS officials to see how they could secure the grounds.

'Free speech' Parler, a social network known for its conservative views, was popular among those who protested against President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the election . By . John O'Donnell . Amazon has suspended Amazon Web Services (AWS) service from the far-right social network Parler. Parler has been using AWS to host the site since 2016. Amazon announced the suspension on its website today, which does not specifically state why it has suspended AWS service, but in a statement said that Parler had failed to comply with the terms of use of AWS, and would no longer be able to use AWS until the site complies with the terms. The suspended service is crucial for Parler, because Parler is currently unable to move its website to a different hosting service, as Amazon's decision could shut down the site without a new cloud provider, meaning all of Parler's users would lose their accounts. Parler's CEO, John Matze, responded to the news of Amazon's decision to ban Parler from its cloud services. He told CNBC that Amazon, Google, and Apple are colluding to eliminate competition. 'It is clear to all that Parler, which has long been the darling of the alt-right community, was the first and only true alternative to Facebook and Twitter. Amazon and the rest of the tech giants are trying to suppress innovation and free speech. We will fight back. It is a victory for democracy, and a victory for the free-speech movement,' Matze said. He added that the tech giants are only doing this for the profits that Amazon makes from the advertising they can place on Parler's site. Amazon said that users of Parler will no longer be able to use Parler unless they delete the violent incitement posts the site currently carries, and Amazon has stated that it is willing to negotiate with Parler on a deal to remove the posts.

Miller's attorney said that Miller had no idea he was involved in the Capitol riot when he was arrested. He also said that Miller was not affiliated with any far-right groups and had not been in contact with them. Miller, who is being held in a jail in Minneapolis, is charged with three felonies, including entering the U.S. Capitol without a valid purpose, resisting law enforcement and engaging in a criminal street gang. The complaint also alleges that Miller had social media posts that indicated he planned to take the United States Capitol with a mob that had broken into the building. He initially denied involvement in the Capitol riot on social media and on January 18 said that he was disgusted by the violence, according to documents. However, he later admitted to his involvement in the riot. Prosecutors are requesting that Miller remain jailed while awaiting trial, citing the incriminating nature of his T-shirt and social media posts, according to legal documents. The complaint states: Miller was wearing a T-shirt that said \"Take America Back\" and \"I Was There, Washington D.C., January 6, 2021,\" the complaint said. Prosecutors are also seeking that Miller be sentenced to up to 12 months in jail for contempt of court. Garret Miller, 23, appeared on Jan. 18 in court, according to court records.

Wipro HR Services' global leader on technology and cultural change says technology can play an important role in helping companies to build resilience in the face of change. Kang calls for a two-pronged approach to driving cultural change - the first being to encourage employee experience with technology and psychological safety in the workplace, the second being to nurture employee engagement with technology. Technology can help companies overcome cultural resistance to change and drive cultural agility, he says. Promoting psychological safety and prioritizing employee experience with technology are crucial to driving cultural change, says Jasjit Singh Kang, a leading HR technology expert. By embracing the power of technology, HR organizations can help drive cultural resilience to face change. HR leaders are being urged to look beyond traditional HR functions to explore new ways of enabling organizational culture change. A Wipro executive, Kang, is a tech expert who believes that cultural change can occur more quickly and effectively with technology.

CNN's Chris Cuomo has not been disciplined for involvement in his brother's Cuomo response to allegations . CNN team questioned Cuomo and Cuomo said he would support his brother in the face of the scandal . The Cuomo brothers have become a focus of controversy and debates about journalistic ethics and responsibility . Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment by several former female colleagues and the NY AG Letitia James has accused Cuomo of abuse of power . CNN has a long history of covering scandalous stories involving the media and politics and is the first to report the allegations against Andrew Cuomo and Chris Cuomo is a proven news leader who knows what to say to move audiences to tears, laughs and to tears again. Chris Cuomo's role at the center of the Cuomo scandal is complex, but CNN's approach has not been to punish Cuomo. Rather, we're focusing on the bigger picture. While the Cuomo brothers are among the most closely watched figures in New York politics, Andrew Cuomo is facing impeachment for allegedly sexually harassing a number of former female staffers and for abuse of power. CNN has not disciplined Chris Cuomo, the governor's brother and a senior CNN news anchor in New York City. Why? Because there is a delicate balance in news stories between being able to get the story and allowing people who want to see the story to get to see the story. Andrew Cuomo is not a member of CNN's editorial board, but he is well-liked and respected by CNN staffers. Chris Cuomo has a proven track record of being able to move audiences emotionally. He's also respected by his colleagues and friends on the network. Chris Cuomo, like other news anchors, has to balance journalistic duties with family loyalty. In this case, his family loyalty is towards his brother."}

He was one of the most revered military figures of his time, and a great statesman. Still, his legacy and those of others like him are rarely remembered with a high state funeral in this country. This is especially noticeable in the current moment, during a pandemic and a time of social unrest. In the wake of Colin Powell's funeral, here are three things we need more of in the U.S.: Public funerals. By all accounts, Colin Powell's coffin was brought to Washington National Cathedral on a private plane, following his death from complications of covid-19. While it might have seemed an odd way to transport a former Secretary of State's casket, this was the only way to honor Powell's wishes, according to those who knew him. In many ways, this was a reflection on the division in the U.S. While a private funeral can be a good option for families, it is especially important that a public funeral be given to someone of Colin Powell's stature, so that the world can reflect on his achievements. The post-WWII United States is marked by what some consider to be a division between \"us\" and \"them.\" When the civil rights movement and the Great Migration ended segregation, Americans were united, and the country seemed headed toward a bright future. Over the past several decades, however, Americans have increasingly been torn up over divisive issues such as race, class, gender, and religion. Since the 1950s, Americans have not had a funeral state of their own. While Powell was a great statesman and great military leader, this is not a time for reflection and national healing. Powell's body is currently lying in state for seven days at the Washington National Cathedral, which was his alma mater. After that time, his family will return the casket to Florida to lay him to rest at Camp David, where he had previously spent much of his last days. The casket will be on display during his final resting place at Camp David for seven days. During that time, the nation will reflect on Powell's contributions to the country and to the United States.

President Joe Biden has said that his presidency is \"about healing, not division\", and has pledged to be a leader of the \"greatest generation\". To that end, I believe the United States deserves a president who is humble, caring, thoughtful, and worthy of this great country. That's why I'm writing to urge you not to nominate Donald Trump for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize. This is not my first call on you, nor will be my last. I am grateful that you are listening. It is the responsibility of the next president to ensure that every American has access to the healthcare he or she needs to lead a fulfilled life, regardless of age, race, income level, gender identity, sexual preference, or disability. This will not happen if Trump remains in office. As someone who worked closely with Powell in the 1990s, when it was clear that Donald Trump did not understand the power of the presidency, I have known for some time that Trump would be a terrible president. I have also known that Powell was not the kind of person to let such things slide. The most damning of Powell's mistakes was the decision to leave the Oval Office when Colin Powell was about to be shot on the orders of Trump. If you nominate Trump for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize, you would be sending a clear signal that he should not be allowed to run for office in the future. Joe Biden will take office on Monday, and President-elect Biden has promised a national unity government that will unite the United States to defeat the pandemic and restore the economic fortunes of the American people. In the meantime, I hope you will look to Powell as a symbol of hope for all Americans."}

President Donald Trump is committed to U.S. national interests and to keeping the U.S. out of harm's way. In fact, the people who served in the George W. Bush administration could not have been more different from Trump on a number of issues, including on foreign policy. In addition, President Trump has been more than willing to engage with other nations and willing to put the interests of the U.S. ahead of the interests of other countries. As a result, the Trump administration is in the right place at the wrong time. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is widely expected to play a key role during the George W. Bush administration. Pompeo worked closely with Colin Powell, and he understands Powellian strategy. He will bring a different perspective to the White House than the Bush administration."}

Powell had a unique combination of military and political power, and it is this combination that led him to make some highly controversial decisions in his time as US Secretary of State, for example in the case of the Iraq War. Colin Powell was secretary of state of the United States in the 1990s. Powell took over as the first black secretary of state under President Bill Clinton's administration, and enjoyed a quick rise to become a four-star general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But the former general had to decide whether to invade Iraq, a decision that contradicted the very principle that he had promoted for decades - that the US military should not intervene in other people's domestic politics. Powell doctrine: The Colin Powell doctrine, also known as the 'Powell doctrine', is a policy on foreign intervention that has been popularised by his son Michael, who has published a collection of his father's writings. Here is a summary of Colin Powell's life, and the controversy that marked it. Colin Powell was the first black US secretary of state under Bill Clinton, and one of the most powerful men in Washington D.C.\n\nHe became known for controversial decisions, including invading Iraq to quell what he saw as a threat to US homeland security. But Powell, a retired four-star general who served two terms as a US senator and was a member of the House and Senate armed services committees for decades, also earned the nickname \"Blond Bomber\" for his ability to fly bombers without wearing a oxygen mask.\n\nColin Powell enjoyed fixing things. He loved to repair cars and had a garage in his back yard.\n\nBut in the end, Powell's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 did not go uncontroversial. Colin Powell's role in the Iraq War was so pivotal that he came to be regarded as the grandfather of the doctrine of foreign intervention, and was credited with laying the foundations for the US intervention in Afghanistan in 2001.\n\nHere are some of his lesser-known, but equally important, contributions to US foreign policy.\n\nPowell was first black US secretary of state. Powell took over as the first black secretary of state under President Bill Clinton's administration. He enjoyed a quick rise to become a four-star general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and led the US military in the invasion of Iraq, which was a controversial decision.\n\nPowell became secretary of state of the US under George W.

The U.S. Army is a small part of the large U.S. military and its personnel make up for only 5 percent of the total U.S. military force.

Bush, the nation's Commander-in-Chief, made the decision to send U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf to defend U.S. homeland and citizens from Persian Gulf states that sought to invade and attack the U.S. Bush was concerned that the United States could become involved in a major conflict in the region and he wanted to avoid the kind of warfare that had been occurring in the war-torn former Soviet Union states. Bush decided that the U.S. military would go to the Persian Gulf to defend against a war that would not last more than a year. This would be a short war, with limited use of military force. As a way to assure the U.S. public that the U.S. was not about to go to war, President Bush issued a statement to the nation that it would be a short war and there would be limited use of military force. As a result, there were relatively few protests against the U.S. troop deployment. When President Bush sent the troops to the Persian Gulf, he had to deal with a large troop build-up as well as an increase in U.S. military spending due to the large U.S. troop deployment. U.S."}

His legacy of conflict, from Vietnam to Afghanistan, has left many people mourning. In his time as defense secretary, Rumsfeld presided over the largest military expansion since World War II, including the longest war in U.S. history: the Vietnam War. After 9/11 he was the architect of the Bush administration's war efforts. He also oversaw the deployment of cluster bombs in Afghanistan that inadvertently endangered civilians. This article argues that Rumsfeld's actions were misguided and that the U.S. had a better way of handling the conflict in Afghanistan. There is no doubt that Rumsfeld was a key neoconservative architect of the Bush administration's war efforts post 9/11. But much of his legacy is a legacy of conflict. And it is a conflict that has killed and injured thousands of civilians across the world. Not only were his policies a disaster in Afghanistan, where he presided over a war that killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians, but also in Vietnam, where he allowed the U.S. to launch a full-scale attack on a communist power without proper planning and without any prior warning to the Vietnam government. And as a result of all this, we have lost tens of thousands of lives. And we are unlikely to see a peaceful end to this conflict as long as the policies of Rumsfeld's administration remain in place.

He has also made significant progress on many other issues, including addressing the economy and inequality. In my opinion, Chuck Schumer will soon be the next president as a result of the upcoming U.S. Senate election. Texas and West Virginia have a long and complicated history of voting laws, which have made it hard for minorities, women, and the elderly to vote. Texas and West Virginia are particularly hard on women and the elderly. In my opinion, these states will probably pass new voting laws that make it easier for the elderly and people with disabilities to cast their ballots without fearing discrimination in the voting process.

Donald Trump's claim of having been asked to disavow the QAnon conspiracy theory by his rival Joe Biden in an interview on Thursday night was a sign of desperation, Vanity Fair wrote in a column published on Friday. Donald Trump claimed that he isn't paying attention to the QAnon conspiracy theory because he's so busy fighting COVID-19. However, Trump has argued that Biden is an enemy of the people because he supports pedophilia and child sex abuse, Vanity Fair pointed out. In fact, Biden has been outspokenly critical of both Trump and the QAnon conspiracy theory for months. On Friday, Vanity Fair's David Frum said on his podcast: \"The only way this story is true is if Trump has given in to the demand and the person asking him is lying about it.\" Trump, on the other hand, has repeatedly denied that QAnon is anything like the pedophilia cult it purports to be. \"It's like Trump is a kid who is playing with dolls,\" Dinesh D'Souza, a Republican strategist who has been critical of the QAnon conspiracy theory on his podcast, said last week. As for Trump's support for the QAnon conspiracy theory, it wasn't a major problem at the beginning of the pandemic when Trump's refusal to accept what he considered to be the scientific consensus caused problems, D'Souza said on his podcast."}

The former president has died aged 90, after a long and illustrious political career which included a controversial return to politics, leading to a second term as US President and then as Governor of Texas. Here we look at the key figures in American politics during his presidency and how he was viewed by his fellow politicians. President George W. Bush was one of the most powerful figures in American politics during the George W. Bush presidency, but was controversially returned to politics in 2006 following his first term in office. He was elected Governor of Texas in 2001 to take over from Republican former Governor Dick Cheney, and was reelected to the governorship in 2006. Bush's controversial return to politics led to the first term as US President after he won election in 2004, after the Republican Party lost power to the Democrats. This was followed by a second term as US President in which he focused on bringing the country out of the financial crisis of 2007/8 and becoming a global force for peace and stability. The Republican Party lost control of the US Senate in 2010 to the Democrats, leading to a run-off election where Republican Senator John McCain was defeated. He led the Republican party to the 2012 elections and was elected President again, which was the first time in the party's history that the party had held power in the executive branch for more than four years. After the Iraq War, President Bush advocated for further military action, and took a leading role in the fight against terrorism and the War on Terror. He led the fight against terrorism until 2003, when he announced he would not seek re-election. He retired to painting after the Iraq War and was knighted in 2008 for services to his country, and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the... Bush first ran for US President in the 1988 election but failed to win. He won election as Governor of Texas in 2001 to become the first Republican to hold the office, following his election as Governor of the state in a special race in 2000. He was reelected to the governorship in 2006 and in 2010 won a third term, finishing his first term as governor in 2013 with the highest approval rating in Texas history. He is the second most popular governor in US history behind Democrat Bill Clinton and was the highest paid elected official in Texas history. President Bush led the Republican Party to re-election in 2012 and was elected for a record second term in 2014. He was re-elected to a third term in the 2016 elections.

Senators were worried about the company's lack of a ransomware prevention plan and questioned why it paid the ransom . Asked about whether Colonial Pipeline is a cybersecurity risk to the U.S. , Sen. Dianne Feinstein said the company has serious cybersecurity problems . Blount said Colonial Pipeline was aware of its vulnerability but did not have a plan to prevent it from being abused by hackers . (CNN) A cybersecurity expert testified before U.S. senators this week about a cyberattack on the company that affected fuel deliveries to eastern Texas and Louisiana last month. Joseph Blount, CEO of Colonial Pipeline, told senators that hackers stole a single password for a legacy VPN system without multifactor authentication. He said he is unsure how the hackers' entry to the system unfolded, but added that they used a \"very sophisticated and persistent hack\" that took a \"long time\" to crack. The incident is part of a broader pattern of cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, the senators heard, and led to the disruption of deliveries of crude oil to eastern Texas and Louisiana. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said that Colonial Pipeline is \"a cybersecurity risk to the U.S.,\" and said she is concerned about the company's lack of \"adequate cybersecurity measures\" to protect against such threats. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., asked Blount about why Colonial paid the hackers the equivalent of $700,000 in ransom, saying the payment was \"risky and costly to the company\" and not reflective of the company's commitment to cybersecurity. In a follow-up statement, the company said it did not pay the ransom, and that it had no plan to prevent future attacks. Read the full transcript of Blount's testimony .

The cyberattacker, who targeted the company on May 7 and demanded a ransom, froze its online operations and shut the doors to its main offices . The company paid about $4.4 million in bitcoin for the attack . Colonial Pipeline is among several companies who have had cyberattacks in recent years . The operation marks the first of its kind by a ransomware task force created by the Biden administration . In a press release the Justice Department said the group has been working \"intensively to identify and bring to justice those responsible for cyberattacks such as the one on Colonial Pipeline\" Last year the National Cyber Security and Communications Commission (NCC) said that ransomware attacks were on the rise and the cost paid by victims was also rising . A major fuel supplier has paid a ransom to hackers who targeted its systems, leading to the shutdown of its operations, the Justice Department has revealed. Colonial Pipeline, a major Texas energy company, paid the hackers a total of $4.4 million in bitcoin, equivalent to about £3.2m, to restart its operations following the ransomware attack, the Guardian reports. The hackers froze the company's online platforms on May 7, demanding the payment of about £3.7m to allow them to take back control of the firm's systems, according to a press release from the Department of Justice. After paying for their attack, they shut down the main offices of Colonial Pipeline, forcing the company to cease all operations on May 13. Colonial paid the hackers' ransom to restore operations after the attack . Colonial Pipeline, which supplies fuel to refineries and retailers, has faced a number of cyberattacks in recent years. Earlier this year, for example, hackers who targeted the company in 2017 reportedly cost the company a total of £2.2m in costs. In February 2019, Colonial paid $1.3m to hackers who invaded its systems in 2017 . Earlier this year, CyberArk reported that the number of ransomware attacks in the US had risen by 30% last year."}

How did DarkSide respond to the attack? How did DarkSide make money and why did they target Colonial in the first place? Was this the last attack by DarkSide, or are they likely to return? Take a look at the latest information about the DarkSide ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline and whether they are planning another attack in the future. DarkSide's website is also vulnerable to backdoors found in their operating system. Colonial paid around $5 million for a decryption key, as reported by Bloomberg on May 13. In recent months, DarkSide's ransomware group has targeted other businesses around the world. This has led to criticism of the group's ransomware for its apparent double extortion tactic. Earlier this week, DarkSide released some information about the Colonial attack, including video showing the hackers being led to believe they had been hacked by a spooky man wearing a white hat. However, the website does not contain any of DarkSide's code, suggesting the ransomware attack may have been carried out by a third-party contractor, rather than the hacker collective itself. DarkSide has already targeted other corporations, but this attack is the first time a US-based corporation has taken part in the group's extortion scheme. In a statement released by the US government on May 11, the US State Department said it is aware of DarkSide's attack on Colonial Pipeline. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is investigating the incident. DarkSide is a notorious ransomware group that has previously targeted other US businesses, most recently a bank in Florida earlier this month. However, this is the first time they have targeted a US-based corporation. Colonial Pipeline has paid more than $5 million for a decryption key to unlock its data, according to a Bloomberg report on May 13. Colonial Pipeline is the world's largest pipeline operator and is based in Houston, Texas, US. The pipeline has been targeted in previous attacks, including one in 2017 when hackers stole 100GB of data. That attack appears to have been linked to the SolarWinds cyberattack earlier this year, which has been widely reported. The SolarWinds cyberattack was one of the largest hacks on US infrastructure in recent times. The SolarWinds cyberattack was announced by Microsoft in December 2018, and appears to have targeted US government agencies and US-based companies. The SolarWinds attack was linked to an attack on SolarWinds Orion, a piece of government software, in May 2020. This appears to have been conducted by a third party contractor. DarkSide has previously targeted other US businesses, but this attack is the first time they have targeted a US-based corporation.

Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting companies around the world to steal data, collect a ransom, and spread the malware to other systems.\n\nCybersecurity experts say that companies around the world have been targeted with ransomware in recent years, and last month a major attack highlighted the potential threat ransomware poses to national security and to the economy.\n\nOn March 30, hackers encrypted data at Colonial Pipeline and demanded a ransom of $850,000, or $1.2 million in bitcoin. Security experts say that the $1.2 million was the maximum the company could afford. Even that amount was considered too much for most companies. But the company did comply and paid.\n\nNow, a study conducted by the Ponemon Institute for Cybersecurity suggests that ransomware could cost businesses $16 billion in 2016. This is a jump from the estimated $11.3 billion spent in 2015. The study also found that the amount of ransom paid out by businesses has risen exponentially over the past few years.\n\nThe Ponemon study, which looked at more than 1,700 companies, found that 50 percent of the victims of ransomware attacks in 2016 paid a ransom. The average amount a company paid in ransom last year was estimated at about $312,000. But the report found that the actual average amount paid out was $640,000, and that the average number of days to recover data was about 4.5 days.\n\nCybersecurity expert Dr. David Krebs, author of the Ponemon study and professor at the University of Minnesota, said it was not surprising the average amount paid was higher than the amount paid last year. The reasons for the higher amount were not clear, he said. \"It's always interesting to know what makes people decide to pay,\" Krebs said.\n\nThe Ponemon Institute for Cybersecurity also looked at ransomware attacks on government networks. That category included schools, government agencies, hospitals, and other health care facilities, as well as banks and financial institutions. Of that group, Ponemon found that the average amount paid out in ransom was about $262,000. But the average number of days to recover data was just 2.4 days. The study also found that the amount of ransomware paid out by government networks was the lowest of the three groups.\n\nPonemon found that the most common method of payment was bitcoin, which was used in about a third of ransomware attacks it studied. About a third of attacks also required payment in cash, and about a quarter used credit cards.\n\nPonemon's study found that..."}

The article could end with a question for your readers. The World Health Organization (WHO) supports the development of vaccines to combat global health threats such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. In a press release, the WHO announced Monday that it has given formal approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in adults older than 18. The approval is based on a review by independent experts. The WHO has also approved several vaccines for use in people with serious health conditions or weakened immune systems. The WHO has a number of different vaccines that are approved for use in different populations. Vaccines play a vital role in the fight against diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria. However, for people who have underlying health conditions that make them more susceptible to serious illness, vaccines can also save lives. For example, the CDC said in March that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protected people with diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, COPD and obesity from severe illness. The first vaccines for COVID-19 were approved for use in June 2020, after months of research, testing and development. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has two doses, injected into the arm over two weeks, while the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is a single dose given into the arm. Vaccines can help to protect people against serious illness. However, after receiving the vaccine, people should still follow public health recommendations to keep themselves safe. People who have received a vaccine should stay at the vaccination site for 15 to 30 minutes for observation of possible side effects, such as swelling, redness or discomfort. People who have mild side effects should return to the vaccination site to have them treated. Some severe side effects can be treated in the vaccine site. If someone experiences severe side effects, they should get immediate medical attention. After vaccination, recipients should stay at the vaccination site for 15 to 30 minutes for observation of possible side effects. People with mild side effects should return to the vaccination site to have them treated. Some severe side effects can be treated in the vaccination site.

The test came back positive for a strain of the coronavirus that has since been declared a disease by the World Health Organization.\n\n\"I was put into the (COVID-19) reserve list last week to see if I would be eligible to play, and I'm still eligible to play,\" Rodgers said in a statement released by the team. \"My testing will continue, and I will continue my treatment. I am eager to get back on the sidelines and be back with the team.\"\n\nRodgers previously said that he had been vaccinated and that the antibodies he received from the shot provided protection against the illness. But after the testing positive on March 27, he decided to seek an exemption from the NFL's COVID-19 protocols based on his antibody levels. The request, made on March 27, was denied.\n\nRodgers underwent homeopathic treatment on the weekend to raise his antibodies, which the NFL, NFLPA, and infectious disease consultant did not recognize as valid protection. The NFLPA cited the treatment as being outside of the league's protocols, according to the league's official statement.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers did not respond to a question about whether the treatment had any effect on the Green Bay quarterback's testing result.\n\n\"At this stage, the information is sufficient for us to conclude that (homeopathy) did not have any effect on his positive test result,\" the NFLPA said in a statement released on Sunday."}

At the same time, vaccination against COVID-19 is progressing in many countries. Vaccination will help to halt the spread of the disease and save lives. The best way to protect yourself and your family is to get vaccinated. The greatest burden of COVID-19 remains among older persons and those with comorbidities. WHO prioritizes vaccination for those two populations. Children and adolescents generally experience milder symptoms of COVID-19 compared to adults. Children under the age of five years have a higher risk of diseases with symptoms similar to COVID-19. Children and adolescents can experience 'long COVID-19' and a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome post-infection.

Dr Tulio de Oliveira is a journalist for Nature.com who is writing this article as part of his work reporting on the global health crisis. What is the message? People with HIV and other comorbidities should be prioritised for vaccination against COVID-19. What does this mean? This means that people with HIV should be entitled to priority for vaccination, and access to free treatment should be increased and expanded to ensure that people with HIV and other comorbidities are treated as they should be. Please consider signing the letter to urge health ministers to do so. People with HIV should be entitled to priority for vaccination, and access to free treatment should be increased and expanded to ensure that people with HIV and other comorbidities are treated as they should be. This is a Call to Action for health ministers to give priority consideration to these unique health problems caused by HIV. HIV is a chronic, progressive and life-threatening infection that takes a serious toll on those who are infected, but there is no known cure. Therefore, effective treatment is necessary to reduce viral load, which in turn helps to keep the virus from replicating within people with HIV. This in turn reduces the risk of transmitting the infection to others, especially those who are most vulnerable, like children and pregnant women, and it is the most effective way of preventing HIV transmission to others. This can be done through treatment and access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates has saved more than 3 million lives since its introduction in 1996. HIV can be treated and controlled with ART and HIV drugs are easily available and are free in many countries. Unfortunately, in 2020, the number of people with access to HIV drugs was at a critically low level, causing the WHO to urge all governments to urgently increase treatment coverage in those with HIV. In fact, the latest figures from UNAIDS revealed that treatment coverage for people living with HIV (PLHIV) in low-and middle-income countries has fallen by more than 10% since 2017. Some of the most worrying factors that threaten the health of people with HIV, including those living in the United States, are the lack of access to ART and lack of prevention, which is due to a lack of access to HIV drugs. In Africa, where an estimated 29 million people are living with HIV, the...

The world needs a united, global response to deal with a pandemic that has no borders, and no country can fight it alone. There are so many lessons to be learned from the pandemic, and health systems are stronger when they work together to address global health challenges. I want to share six of those lessons that I have learned during my time as a WHO journalist. As a journalist who covers health, I have seen first-hand the impact of the pandemic on health across the world. This year, in particular, the number of cases in the most vulnerable countries has increased exponentially and they are now facing the worst impacts of the pandemic. The world's health systems have been shattered by the impact of the pandemic and are struggling to cope. This is the biggest global health challenge that we have faced in decades. We need a global response that is united, coordinated and works in tandem with other public health responses to tackle the pandemic, such as mass vaccination campaigns. The vaccine rollout should be accelerated, with all countries, especially in the most vulnerable countries, getting access to vaccines. Vaccines and medicines that are safe, effective and proven to reduce the impact of disease are essential for protecting people and restoring health. The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the need for a united, global response. WHO has been promoting universal and equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and medicines for years. The COVID-19 pandemic shows us the importance of this. The pandemic and other health emergencies are a reminder that we cannot afford to lose sight of universal and equitable access to vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics.

What does this virus mean to America? NBC News explores some of the ways Covid-19 has changed the country and the world, and what we can learn from the past. The 1918 flu was a pandemic that spread quickly around the world. It killed about 675,000 Americans and caused the most deaths in the U.S. since the American Civil War. The virus that causes Covid-19 began in China and spread around the world in the spring of 2020, and has killed more than 675,400 people worldwide. It has killed much more Americans than the 1918 flu, but its impact may be different. Here are some ways that Covid-19 is different from the outbreak of the 1918 flu. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the name for a group of respiratory illnesses caused by a new virus. The first case of the disease was reported in December last year in China. By February, the disease was spreading around the world, killing tens of thousands of people, according to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics. In March, the virus was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern. In April, more than 1,300 cases were confirmed in the U.S., with more than 40 deaths. As the virus continued to spread throughout the U.S., scientists began researching how the disease worked and how best to treat and prevent it. In May, the first case of Covid-19 was officially reported in New York City, prompting widespread social and economic disruption. On May 30, President Trump declared a state of emergency, suspending most non-essential travel between the United States and other countries. As the U.S. responded to the pandemic, the death toll surpassed 675,000 in June.

The Canal is famous in history for its ability to bring goods from one ocean to the other within a week, even during the Napoleonic Wars of the 19th Century. Now, in 2021, the Suez Canal is the subject of a new development that is likely to have long-term implications for international trade: the $19 billion (Â£13 billion) reconstruction of the canal, which is due to be finished in 2026. The Suez Canal is not the only way to reach Asia. The Strait of Malacca connects the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. The best route between the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia is the Panama Canal. In its heyday, the canal handled more than 1.6 million tonnes of cargo a year. The Panama Canal, on the other hand, is much narrower than the Suez Canal, with a maximum depth of just 4.2 metres (13.7 feet). The Suez Canal runs a width of 2560 metres (9500 feet). The Panama Canal has a maximum depth of 10 metres (32 feet). In 2021, a cargo ship broke through an opening in the wall of the Suez Canal and sank, blocking the entire canal. It is believed that the Ever Given cargo ship ran aground on the west side of the canal, at the Suez Canal Breakwater, which separates the eastern basin from the western basin of the Suez Canal. The Ever Given was originally loaded in South Korea. The Suez Canal is a vital route for trade, but in 2021, the ship Ever Given ran aground and blocked the entire canal for six days (Ever Given ran aground in 2021 and blocked the Suez Canal for six days).

The accident at the Suez Canal could have been far worse, had the container ship not been diverted to the port of Mombasa instead of the port of Ismailia. In the run-up to the inauguration of the new U.S. administration, we take a look at the causes of this tragedy and what we can learn from it. One of the lessons that we have learned from the recent shipwreck at the Suez Canal is the importance of communication and the need for better communication in order to prevent accidents like this in the future. We have learned that the relationship between management and crew should be strong and trusting. In this case, communication was poor, and this was the source of the problem. So if the management and the crew can improve their relationship, I think accidents like the Suez Canal will be much less likely in the future. The accident at the Suez Canal could not have happened if the operator of the ship, Everting Marine, had made the right choices. So it was the human factor that played a major role. What we can learn from this is that the operators of container ships should pay more attention to human factors and the need to improve communication between the management and the crew."}

The Suez Canal blockade highlighted vulnerabilities in global supply chains and the importance of crisis management plans. The recovery from such crisis requires a detailed plan including goals, tasks, timeframes, required resources, and stakeholders to be notified. Peter Deans, an expert on contingency plans and supply chains, shares his view on the crisis and discusses how businesses should plan for contingency. There are a number of reasons why businesses should have contingency plans for various scenarios in their supply chains, from transportation disruption to supply shortages to weather events. The following are examples where companies may want to create a contingency plan for an event in their supply chain. Businesses should work with their suppliers to create a contingency plan for a supply shortages scenario. To do so, they will need to know what happens during normal events, what happens during a supply event, what will happen during a contingency event, and how they are going to work together to avoid the contingency event. The contingency plan will then outline how the company's suppliers will work together to avoid the contingency scenario. Businesses should also work with their customers to create a contingency plan for a transportation disruption scenario. To do so, they will need to know what happens during normal events, what happens during a transportation event, what will happen during a contingency event, and how they are going to work together to avoid the contingency event.

It's just one in a long list of fake pictures circulated on the internet following a major disruption to the Suez Canal on March 23. This morning we learned that after the Ever Given had been released from its position on the canal, it began its usual route. So it's important to remember that while this photo is a plausible depiction of the Ever Given cargo ship's route before it was caught in the Suez Canal, the ship's route hasn't always been as it is now. So what was the actual route of the Ever Given? Was the ship intended to be drawn in the way that the photo appears to be? Was the route intended to resemble a crude drawing of a penis? First things first: a picture is worth a thousand words, but this one isn't worth too much. The image is genuine and shows the same route as the ship has always taken before it was stuck in the Suez Canal. That means the following things.\n\nThe image depicts the full route of the Ever Given cargo ship from the start of its usual route, through the Suez Canal, out to the shipyard that it was built at in the Port of Mombasa. It was drawn in exactly the same way as the route is now, with the lines drawn in the same scale as the lines on the physical map. It does not resemble a drawing of a penis. And, importantly, it is not a drawing of the route that was taken by the Ever Given when it got caught in the Suez Canal.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the photo was posted to Twitter by the ship's owner, but not by the company that ran the Suez Canal, nor by the company that owns the ship. While the photo is true, there's nothing to suggest it was meant to look like a crude drawing of a penis. It was not the intention to draw the route of the ship in this way. What's next\n\nThe Ever Given was released from its position on the canal on Monday, March 23, and the usual route has been taken since.

The huge vessel has slowed movement of goods from China to Europe through the channel, which is used by around half of all cargo ships passing through the Arabian Sea. In the past two weeks, China has been importing more than a third of its imports through the canal, and it is expected that this trend will continue until the end of the Lunar New Year holiday next week.

Its team of journalists and analysts specialize in international business, finance, political issues and business news, with an emphasis on Nigeria and the African continent. Here are some of the highlights from this article. On March 25, 2021, The Ever Given, a cargo ship carrying fertiliser and fertiliser chemicals, docked in the Port of Suez, blocking the Suez Canal. This led to the stoppage of the world's third busiest shipping route connecting Asia to Europe. The Ever Given is a container ship carrying cargo of fertiliser and fertiliser chemicals. It is estimated that around 12% of global trade passes through the Suez Canal, which is crucial to the economy of the country, Nigeria. The incident has led to the closure of the canal, and the closure of the Suez Canal Zone, which is a trading zone in Egypt, which is home to ports, industrial zones and manufacturing plants. It is home to companies such as Samsung, BP and Shell, so the closure of the Suez Canal affects the economy of Egypt as a whole. The Ever Given was initially expected to be docked at the Port of Suez, which is Egypt's largest, on March 24, 2021. However, it had to be docked in the Port of Suez on March 25. As the Suez Canal is a busy shipping route, blocking it led to the disruption of 12% of international trade. The Suez Canal plays an important role in global trade, connecting Asia and Europe. As Nigeria is an import-dependent country, the closure of the Suez Canal has caused Nigeria's economy to suffer. Global economic recovery could be slowed due to the incident, and some experts believe the global economic impact will grow as the situation worsens. The Ever Given is a cargo ship, and it was carrying cargo of fertiliser and fertiliser chemicals. The Suez Canal is an ancient canal which opened to the public on 25th of April 1869, and connects Europe, Africa and Asia. The incident could worsen the economic impact of Covid-19 due to the closure of the Suez Canal, which is the third busiest shipping route in the world, which is vital to the economy of Egypt. The Ever Given was initially expected to be docked at the Port of Suez on March 24, 2021. However, it had to be docked in the Port of Suez on March 25. The Ever Given has an estimated cargo value of about US$11.7 billion and has been docked at the Port of Suez in the Port of Suez, a hub of trade in Egypt. The Ever Given is expected to dock at Port of Suez on March 26, 2021."}

By Mark Avery, director of education and research for Atlantictech.com\n\nEver Given ship is stuck in Suez Canal\n\nEver Given is longer than the Empire State Building\n\nIn an industry where there is a critical shortage of space, Ever Given has come to symbolize an invisible infrastructure of global capital, supply chains and infrastructure that needs to be more transparent, more collaborative, and more open to the world.\n\nStarting on Wednesday, August 3, 2021, The Guardian will host a series of articles exploring the challenges, pitfalls, opportunities and complexities of the Ever Given container ship. It's been a month since one of the largest container ships to ever enter the Suez Canal went awol. The ship, operated by Evergreen, was in the water for more than two weeks and is currently the biggest container ship ever to get stuck in a canal, with a diameter that is smaller than a football field. Scroll down for video\n\nThe size of the container ship is mind-blowing, and the fact that the ship has been stuck in a canal for so long makes it even more spectacular. Ever Given's predicament has highlighted the normally invisible infrastructure of global capital and supply chains. It is both an indictment of our capitalist economy and a call to greater transparency and collaboration, as the Guardian's Mark Avery explains. Ever Given is longer than the Empire State Building, the largest building ever built and the world's tallest building, according to CNN. It's also longer than the Statue of Liberty and nearly twice the size of the Eiffel Tower. The Ever Given has become a symbol of global logistics and capitalism, with memes and global attention focused on the ship itself. It has become an instant symbol for something bigger and more important than the Suez Canal: the global shipping industry as a whole.

Efforts to free the ship accelerated yesterday with some traffic expected to resume today, the paper adds. The ship ran aground on Thursday and is now partly moving alongside the bank. The ship is blocking the canal for almost two days after a malfunction that forced the captain to abort the container voyage to New Zealand. Some experts fear that the Evergreen Marine Corp company which leases the ship is using tactics to prolong the blockage to extract rents from the container owners, the paper notes. The ship is a 'megaship' that can carry up to 50,000 containers and has been described by some as a giant cargo container ship. The company has previously been reported to be in possession of several ships in the Suez Canal area, the Guardian reports, but this one is the largest container ship on record and the largest ever to run into the Suez Canal.

In a statement released Tuesday, the carrier's owners have blamed the captain's erratic tactics for the accident that stranded them for nine hours. It took engineers from the company and military helicopters to free the ship and its 46,000 deadweight tonnage cargo of containers from the banks of the canal. How did the Ever Given captain cause the accident? The ship's crew and pilots tried to avoid it, but the captain refused to turn to one side or the other of the canal, despite the advice of Canal pilots. What do the ship's owners want? Egypt wants $916.5 million in damages, according to the statement. But the Maritime & Coastguard Authority and maritime experts say they're skeptical of the claim, especially as the Maritime & Coastguard Authority had no control over the decision to allow the ship to enter the Suez Canal, reports NBC News.

The canal was built in the 19th century, connecting Europe and Africa. The canal has faced numerous problems in recent years such as floods, silt, leaks, and vandalism. Now, however, Suez Canal officials plan to widen and deepen a stretch of the canal to prevent future blockages like the one in March, when hundreds of ships were stranded for three weeks. If you are an organizer who wants to learn from past crises and implement reforms to prevent recurrence, Starbucks may be a good example to look into. In March, Starbucks was criticized for an alleged racial bias incident involving a manager. The incidents resulted in the company conducting anti-racism training for its employees. In other crises, the U.S. Secret Service has been criticized for a perceived lack of transparency and accountability. But, as the Secret Service's new chief executive noted, these problems can be overcome with an \"innovative approach,\" as long as steps are taken to make sure that the organization's actions are transparent."}

The service outage was attributable to human error, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said . Facebook said it suffered a series of maintenance failures during the outage . Some experts and users were quick to speculate that the outage was caused by military action, as rumors spread online . (CNN) -- You might have seen online that the military raided Facebook and caused the service to briefly halt on Oct. 4. The claim is a hoax and Facebook was forced to deny it. This was the company's most serious data center outage in years, according to a statement from Mark Zuckerberg on the company's blog on Oct. 5: \"We're all still shaking our heads and processing that this was the worst outage we have ever seen,\" he said. \"We were lucky to get through another day.\" If Mark Zuckerberg were to die in a car crash, CNN would say, \"Lucky he didn't have a job to do today,\" and we would be right. The real reason why Facebook was down was because we are human and we make mistakes. We know what the damage we have done to millions of users was terrible, but we want to make clear that we are here to fix it. We are working hard every day to fix it . Most of the outage happened when Facebook attempted to migrate data from servers running on older technology to newer technology. The migration took longer than expected, which is why many users may not have been able to log in to the service for six hours. When the migration was complete, Facebook restored data and services. The company said it had restored 99% of the service. The migration may have caused the outage. As for the military raid theory: It was a hoax; it originated with a Twitter user claiming that he had seen U.S. military personnel trying to take down the site, but he later retracted that claim . The military raided Facebook? That's a hoax, and it started on Twitter, according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (CNN) -- A six-hour outage on Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp appeared to be the result of military action, but it was not the case, the company said Monday. Mark Zuckerberg said on Facebook's blog that the problem was caused by \"human error during routine maintenance\" and promised the company would fix it. The outage occurred on Oct. 4, Mark Zuckerberg told CNN, when Facebook attempted to migrate data from servers running on older technology to newer technology. \"It was a very difficult migration and it required a large amount of work to complete,\" Zuckerberg said at the time. \"We'd like to apologize to all of those affected by this,\" the company said in a statement."}

While Facebook responded with a statement emphasizing that its privacy policies are designed to maintain users' trust and protect their personal data, Ocasio-Cortez responded that the company's monopolistic behavior is not at odds with democracy. Facebook decided Wednesday to halt the transfer of its users' WhatsApp and Instagram messages to its Messenger service.

The statement added: In the wake of Facebook's abrupt decision to stop all messaging services, I was forced to look up what the rest of the world was talking about. Facebook's messaging blackout has not been widely covered. But it has had a significant impact on Latin America because WhatsApp is used by an estimated 65% of all cellphone users there. It is not the only messaging app used by that region. WhatsApp users can still communicate via other apps like Viber. In an interview with Forbes, Forbes editor José Caparroso said that the Facebook decision was significant in Latin America because WhatsApp was used by the vast majority of people in the region. Viber has also been an alternative to WhatsApp, but it has not been widely used. As for Instagram, the company had been working to make its own messaging service separate from Facebook, but efforts to develop the service were thwarted by Facebook's decision. He said the blackout was just the latest way that Facebook was able to expand its profits at the expense of consumers. The statement said the move was not a violation of Facebook's privacy policy, which protects users' data, and it was meant to maintain users' trust in Messenger. Caparroso, who is also a political scientist, said the move by Facebook was significant, because it allowed the firm to gain access to the users' data while maintaining the illusion of user privacy.

In its verdict, the court added that Facebook's community standards, which prohibit users from posting content that constitutes a direct threat to another person, violated European law. The Federal Court of Justice also condemned Facebook for not offering users a right of appeal against their posts being removed and their accounts being blocked. \"The Federal Court of Justice's decision demonstrates that Facebook, as a media company, is responsible towards its users,\" Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.

In 2015, a report by the United Nations found that Syrian doctors were more likely to die in the conflict than patients in attacks from rebels."}

Facebook has been criticized for relying too heavily on the company's single platform for business operations, such as marketing, customer support, and communications. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) is in the process of developing a decentralized messaging system that allows messaging platforms to compete with each other. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook would not invest any more money into the Facebook-owned messaging apps. This new messaging service will allow the company to compete with other messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, which has been able to grow quickly because of its strong consumer-focused strategy. Although the company's messaging apps were down for a short time, this was enough for many customers to believe that Facebook was no longer reliable. In some cases, customers preferred Facebook to using a website to contact their local fire department. In the first half of 2017, Facebook was the first place businesses spent on advertising in the U.S. In 2017, more than $1 billion was spent on Facebook advertising and the company's advertising revenue topped $12 billion. This also indicates that brands and organizations are using Facebook and its messaging apps to communicate with customers, but they are also relying on Facebook for business operations such as marketing and customer support. According to experts, if you plan to use social media, you must consider a number of factors before choosing a platform to use for your business operations. These factors include the following. If you plan to use Facebook for your company's business operations, you must understand that Facebook is not the only platform you need to use. You should diversify the types of platforms you use for various business operations. You may find the services offered by a platform that does not use the internet, such as a mobile app, is better for business operations such as customer service. For example, you might prefer to use a mobile app instead of a desktop application for customer service. Another disadvantage of relying on a single platform could be that you might be vulnerable to a cyberattack."}

Nearly a third of Facebook users have facial recognition features enabled and the company says about 1 billion people have access to the technology . Facial recognition, a controversial tech tool used by police and surveillance firms, has long been used by Facebook on its mobile users.

In an announcement on Thursday Facebook said the system will no longer be in use. It added that it had been discontinued after five years, with no timetable for when it would be replaced. The announcement comes after the company was hit by a $850 million fine from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a $650 million legal settlement with Illinois residents in which it agreed to pay compensation for the company's use of their data.

It said these were part of a wider effort by Facebook to identify and remove groups where fraudulent reviews were being traded. Fake reviews involve purchasing positive reviews to boost sales or negative reviews to harm competitors, coordinated on Facebook and Instagram. It is not known how much money has been lost by businesses that took part in the fraudulent trades. For example, a competitor's Facebook page could be filled with negative reviews, while the fake reviews could be positive. The CMA said Facebook is still struggling to remove groups where fake reviews are still being sold, and is therefore disappointed by the company's delayed response. The CMA did not name Facebook's names in its statement, but said it would be addressing concerns about the social network over what it called \"other areas\".

Facebook's security team found that the misconfiguration which caused the outage involved the configuration of its backbone routers. An audit tool was used to configure these routers and the mistake was missed. The outage started when a maintenance engineer attempted to test the capacity of Facebook's backbone routers and accidentally disabled the border gateway protocol (BGP) routers, which connect the data centres to the internet. As a result, Facebook's DNS servers couldn't translate domain names into IP addresses, which meant users were unable to access Facebook as well as the other apps affected by the outage. So what went wrong? And what can Facebook do to avoid such mistakes in the future? The outage started on 4 October when a fault was found during routine maintenance on Facebook's backbone routers. What caused the outage? A configuration error meant that Facebook's backbone routers cut the internet links to the data centres, which affected 2.9 billion users of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. Why was the error not caught? Because a security audit tool failed to catch it, allowing the misconfiguration to be deployed across Facebook's entire network environment. What did the outage mean for Facebook? Facebook's DNS servers couldn't translate domain names into IP addresses, which meant users were unable to access Facebook and the other affected apps.

Exploiting the system of racial control and exploitation that exists at the heart of American policing, Derek Chauvin and his fellow officers racially discriminated against unarmed black men in Minneapolis. But their actions did not justify killing them and they will not be pardoned.\n\nChauvin's conviction signals that the United States is moving in new directions. It is time to end the endless cycle of racism, white supremacy and policing that is killing tens of thousands of black and brown Americans each year.\n\nRead David Leonhardt's full column here\n\nEven without racial bias, policing won't solve the problems of inequality and exploitation. One of the many tragedies of the United States has been that people have not considered policing as a system of racial discrimination.\n\nThe system works as follows. We are all equally entitled to the freedom of movement under the rule of law. That is the cornerstone of our democracy. In other words, when we are at the mercy of a police officer who decides whether we can go to the grocery store or a convenience store, it is not a free society.\n\nFor decades, police, many of whom were white, discriminated and exploited black and brown people in the name of protecting the public. The result is that Americans are at the mercy of the police and they depend on them for access to basic human needs.\n\nAt a time when we need to focus the anger about the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer on racism, the system of racial control and exploitation at the heart of American policing should also be considered. This is not a problem of George Floyd's death alone. It is a system that benefits white supremacists and racists, but harms blacks and brown people.\n\nBut most importantly, the system of racial control and exploitation creates a cycle of violence that lasts many years. By killing unarmed black people in the name of protecting the public, white supremacists are creating a vicious cycle of revenge. The result is that many black and brown men and women are killed by police in the same way that George Floyd was killed.\n\nChauvin's conviction signals that the United States is moving in new directions. It is time to end the endless cycle of racism, white supremacy, and policing that is killing tens of thousands of black and brown Americans each year."}

In this interview, Clark says the lawyers on trial are trying to make the case for what they should and shouldn't be convicted of.\n\nThe transcript was provided to the Journal by Steven Clark. The Associated Press has not independently verified the accuracy of this transcript. Q: You were one of the first lawyers to work with the prosecutors in this case. How did you feel about the choice of the prosecution team? Steven Clark: I think they selected the right lawyers. Erin Eldridge and Matthew Frank are two very experienced attorneys that understand the criminal justice system. They have worked on many high-profile cases, including Eric Holder's and John Ashcroft's cases. They have tremendous experience. It was important for them to have a lot of experience on this case and to represent the interests of the government, which is the interest of all of us. There is a lot of attention being paid to how the trial is going because this is a high-profile case and it's important that it goes well for everyone. Q: How do you feel about the number of attorneys on trial? Do you think it's too large for the jurors to get a good sense of the individual attorneys? Steven Clark: I think it's the right number of attorneys. It's not a one-size-fits-all trial. I have never worked with a trial that had 10 or more attorneys on trial, so I don't know. I only know what I've seen in other trials. But the number of attorneys is what it is."}

The verdict is due on a number of charges including second-degree murder, manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. Derek Chauvin is accused of killing George Floyd during a Minneapolis police custody investigation on May 25, 2020. Here are the five most important things you need to know about the case this week:\n\nAs a result, Derek Chauvin was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of George Floyd and acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter, though he was found guilty of a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter in the death of 3-year-old Trayvon Martin, and was sentenced to 21 years to life in prison and ordered to pay $300,000 in civil damages to George Floyd's family. The other jurors agreed with the decision and returned a 12-1 vote to convict Chauvin of manslaughter. The jury acquitted Chauvin of involuntary manslaughter and second-degree murder, with 11 other jurors supporting acquittal. Howard wrote that she was not sure what the jury found, as she was not present during the deliberations. But she believed the bodycam footage and expert testimony were critical to the conviction, and she will be watching the verdict in hopes it supports her position, she said. Dr. Martin Tobin's testimony, asserting George Floyd died from asphyxiation, impacted Howard significantly, she said. She praised that he did not receive payment for his testimony, adding to his credibility, as well as Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo's testimony against Chauvin's tactics. Howard's comments came after the conclusion of Monday's deliberations and before her verdict is read aloud on Wednesday at 1:01 a.m. ET.

On August 1, the Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to rename George Floyd Square, marking the square as a memorial for Floyd, and the movement's new headquarters as well as a place to honor all lives lost to police brutality. The story of George Floyd's death is still unfolding and will not be resolved soon, but the following key points are worth recalling.\n\nFloyd died in Minneapolis police custody after Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nine minutes. pic.twitter.com/yKz6UyQ6xU Chauvin was sentenced to a minimum of 22.5 years and a maximum of 39 years in prison, and the sentence will run concurrently with the 25 years for his murder conviction.\n\nThe other three officers involved in Floyd's death were arrested on charges of aiding and abetting in the murder, manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.

The judge also noted the presence of children during the crime and Chauvin's role in a group during the offense. Chauvin, convicted of three counts, will be sentenced on the most serious one, second-degree unintentional murder.

Protesters are demanding justice for the unarmed Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer held his neck for more than seven minutes, or else they will take over the city's streets, protesters say. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) Calls for Protesters to 'get more confrontational' if Derek Chauvin is acquitted in George Floyd's killing Waters' comments drew immediate criticism from Republicans who claimed she was inciting violence, a claim she denies. In Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, Waters' comments are being seen as a sign that she might join the demonstrators. If so, she will be the only Democratic member of Congress to join them, and will likely come under intense media pressure to deflect calls for impeachment from her own party. Republicans say Ms. Waters and other Democrats are being hypocritical by supporting the Black Lives Matter movement but criticizing her Republican colleagues who have not done enough to address police brutality issues in their states. Many of the protests were triggered by a video that emerged last week that showed a white Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on the neck of the unarmed Black detainee, George Floyd, for more than seven minutes as he begged for his life."}

More than 200 protesters have been charged with various offenses after the protests, and some have been arrested in large numbers in cities across the country. Chauvin, 41, is being held without bond after being found guilty of murder in the death of Floyd, who had been handcuffed and kneeled on the ground for nearly nine minutes after police officers asked him to put his hands behind his head and breathe normally, according to a sworn statement taken by Minneapolis detective Tou Thao. \"That's what I would have done,\" the detective said.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the use of lethal force by police. However, in recent weeks, the justices have been grappling with the constitutionality of the laws that allow police and armed guards to use lethal force on unarmed suspects—especially with regard to mass shootings by police. While the death of George Floyd has sparked a national conversation about gun violence, the recent spike in mass shootings by police is just as troubling. In April, the number of police-involved shootings reached a record 147 in the U.S., with more than 60 people killed since the beginning of the Derek Chauvin trial. In some cases, police have killed more victims than shooters, despite the high number of police shootings and deaths. The Trump administration supports gun control and has recently proposed legislation that would require gun owners to carry concealed handgun permits. However, the Supreme Court has upheld the use of lethal force by police, leading some policymakers to push for more strict gun laws. This can create a vicious cycle as more guns lead to more homicides, according to Michael Levitt, an expert on gun violence at New America."}

Still, much of the conversation about the case has focused on his weapon, a semi-automatic assault rifle. In fact, two other people were injured while attempting to confront Rittenhouse, and his injuries included a gunshot wound to the back of his head that required him to be hospitalized. Wisconsin's long rifle law allows people to carry a short rifle for hunt purposes. That law, however, allows long rifles to be used only for hunting purposes if the person holds the weapon in a \"safe, stable, and controlled\" position. The gun's barrel was much longer than the shortest rifles that are considered safe and stable. Therefore, Rittenhouse was not allowed to carry his rifle in a controlled position. The short-barreled rifles that Rittenhouse carried were not considered long enough, so his possession of the gun was deemed legal under Wisconsin's long rifle law, which allows people to carry short-barreled rifles for hunting. In Wisconsin, Rittenhouse is accused of three charges: possession of a loaded firearm during a riot, possession of a loaded firearm by a person under the age of 21, and possession of a firearm during a riot that resulted in serious bodily injury.\n\nRittenhouse, a resident of Kenosha, faces a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for shooting Joseph Rosenbaum, the first person killed in the protest.

Hurricane Ida could cost New Orleans billions of dollars in repairs and the loss of up to 400,000 jobs. That is why it is important to look beyond just rebuilding and rethinking the city we live in. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from Hurricane Ida, which hit the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans in 2005 and left the city in ruins. In fact, Hurricane Ida could teach us that we must rethink our ways of building and living. So far, the response has been slow and uncoordinated, leading to inefficiency and misplaced priorities. How do we fix that? In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, there was widespread outrage that the levees of New Orleans were unable to protect the city. The Army Corps of Engineers had been designed to hold more than 30 inches of storm surge, which is the equivalent of a 25-year rainfall, and yet the levees failed in the face of Hurricane Katrina's massive storm surge. Although the levee structure failed, it held for a month, as the levees were in different places. It is more than likely that New Orleans is in a similar situation today. There is only one transformer in the city, and if we do not fix it, New Orleans will not be able to power itself. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the government set up a Hurricane Response Agency. It was designed to centralize power so that New Orleans would not be left in the dark. Although the response to Hurricane Ida has been more decentralized than that of Hurricane Katrina, it is clear that the current system is not working. The city could not power itself and, in the end, had to rely on generators and a single turbine to get power. This means that New Orleans will have to spend a lot of money on power for the rest of its life. If we do not fix the problem, New Orleans will have to spend a lot of money on power for the rest of its life. In fact, fossil fuel companies have been at the center of New Orleans's problems. It is clear that oil major ExxonMobil has been at the center of New Orleans's problems. After the levee failed, the company did not pump oil out to make money, but did so for free. Why does ExxonMobil do this? Because they are a major player in fossil fuels and they know that if they pump out the oil, the city will have to pay for it. So they pump the oil out for free, leaving the city with the burden of paying for the damage."}

The American Psychiatric Association reported an increase in anxiety, depression and PTSD among front-line healthcare workers .

A massive hurricane in Louisiana ripped the roof off a Houma hospital . By . John Sutter . and John Harnish . Associated Press . A massive hurricane hit Louisiana's south . A massive storm tore a roof off a Houma hospital on Monday night, flooding the hospital's surgical floor and leaving patients lying in pools of water . The storm hit south Louisiana as a COVID-19 surge forced the evacuation of thousands of people, including many patients from the Houma Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center. The storm took a massive toll on the city, particularly on health workers. The Houma hospital has been operating since 1870, but it was not ready for this type of storm . The hospital, which is undergoing a major renovation and expansion, was already overwhelmed by the number of COVID-19 patients it received as the devastating virus swept through Houma and other parts of the state. At the time of the storm, the medical center was already running on its last reserves of water because of the thousands of patients it was processing at the same time as its overflowing COVID-19 patients. \"It was more than just a hurricane,\" said hospital's CEO, Jay Smith. \"It felt like a very long, heavy weight was on my shoulders.\" The hospital was not prepared for the kind of storm it encountered on Monday night. In the initial stages of the storm, water started to pour down from the hospital's roof, the CEO said. By the time the flood was under control, it had soaked the medical center's surgical floor and left patients lying in puddles of water. As the storm progressed, Smith said the hospital's patients were evacuated and discharged to other hospitals in the region, as they could not be risked being evacuated back to their flooded rooms. As a result, the number of patients the medical center was processing at the same time was significantly reduced, the CEO said."}

Sellars has said that he doesn't know how many residents have stayed behind after the levees were breached, but he estimates that at least 400 people are in the area. Sellars has told the Daily Memphian, \"There are a lot of people who can't evacuate because of financial reasons. There are those who are homeless. There are people who are homeless and can't afford to purchase a car.\" The storm surge in Jefferson Parish is hitting the area harder than anywhere else in the state, Sellars tells Fox 31. The storm surge was at 10 feet today, according to the National Hurricane Center, but is expected to rise to 12 feet by tomorrow. Sellars tells the Daily Memphian that it takes at least a week to evacuate the levees, which have already been breached. Some people, he tells the station, are staying behind for a variety of reasons. \"Some of them have family back home,\" Sellars says. \"They have to make sure that their family is OK.\" Sellars also says that there is no power in the area because the storm surge has knocked out power. Cell phone and internet service has been severely affected as well. \"We're just going to be out of communication because of the storm,\" Sellars says. \"There are a lot of phone lines out."}

A bomb has exploded at a school in the heart of the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing at least 83 people, mainly girls aged 13 to 18, officials have said. The attack at the school in Hazara neighborhood, which has been a hotbed of militant activity for years, was carried out by U.S.-led forces, the U.S. said.

The Hazaras, who live in the area of the school that was attacked, are among the most marginalized and vulnerable people in the country.

It marked the deadliest U.S. military action in the war. The bombing was the culmination of months of intense diplomatic and military negotiations between the United States and the Taliban, culminating in the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan on December 29, 2001. In the aftermath of that invasion, the U.S. military fought the Taliban and other warlords, establishing a military presence throughout the country that has remained consistent since. Despite U.S. and Afghan leaders repeatedly warning the public that the airport could be bombed, many people still decided to cross the border into Pakistan for fear of attacks. After the bombing, many of the casualties were left in the Afghan refugee camps. We hear about their lives from Afghan journalists and members of the U.S. military, and from U.S. officials. We hope these stories will remind us to keep fighting the war, and never give up hope that a better future is possible. On this day last year, many U.S. service members and Afghan civilians lost their lives as a result of an airstrike at Kabul International Airport.

This is what some women are worried about, according to this week's story by CNN's Vanessa Been. Rashida Yasin writes from Kabul that for some women, the return of the Taliban to power is a bad thing. Here's why: It will be hard to make progress if there is no support of women - and there isn't much if the Taliban doesn't take them seriously, she says. In Herat, dozens of women have staged a protest demanding equal rights and equal opportunities - and there are calls for more similar protests in Kabul. Here is some of Vanessa Been's other stories this week: 1. This week's report from Afghanistan shows that as the U.S. pulls out, there are signs of life on the ground that could signal a positive turn for women . 2. Some fear that the Taliban's promise of a better future for women will be hollow . 3. Other women say the Taliban is not going to allow for equal rights in the near future . 4. Many women in the country have also suffered the devastation of war . The Afghan capital of Kabul is beginning to see signs of life returning after American troops pulled out. The airport and a hospital have reopened. But the Taliban is also back in power and some women are worried that the return could be a bad thing. They fear they will not have equal rights, especially in the new cabinet. And some say the Taliban is not going to allow equal rights in the near future. Women from Herat in western Afghanistan have staged a protest demanding equal rights, equal opportunities, and access to basic services. They want to work and send their sons to school. \"I want women to be included in the government so the government can do something for women,\" she tells CNN. \"I am a woman and I want to go to school, work and send my sons to school. I want a good life for my sons.\" She says she hopes the government will change soon. The Taliban's previous rule in the late 1990s was marked by severe oppression, particularly towards women.

As the US vice president, she is a frequent poster on Twitter, but Harris is also known for taking a personal approach to security. Politico published a story about the vice president's reluctance to wear Bluetooth headphones, and the reaction was almost entirely negative, with a mixture of mockery and serious skepticism. Scroll down for video The vice president and her team are in the process of updating the security guidelines for any technology connected to the secure network of the executive mansion on Pennsylvania Avenue, the official said. Harris is expected to present the guidelines at an event in late February, which will help to outline her security concerns. Scroll down for video Harris' approach to the security of her communications technology has been met with scepticism within her own administration. While some of her fellow staffers have dismissed her concerns as paranoid, others have backed her stance on security technology, according to reports. Harris and Chad Loder studied computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford University. Harris' team has previously said the vice president uses the internet and electronic devices in order to keep in touch with her staff, friends and family members. The administration has not yet disclosed the nature of her fears about Bluetooth, but Citizen Lab found a way to hack into an iPhone running on the Bluetooth protocol, the group that built a similar tool that has been used to break into a number of government networks. In a statement, Citizen Lab said the team was unable to break into any of the devices running Bluetooth. Citizen Lab said it was unable to breach any of the devices running Bluetooth.

Rittenhouse remains in the Kenosha Police Department after his arrest on Dec. 1 . A judge has ruled against the defense request to have a use-of-force expert testify at trial . The hearing at the Kenosha Circuit Court was set for Oct. 21 . Rittenhouse is accused of killing two people and injuring an additional three during a mob attack . (CNN) A judge denied a request by the defense Tuesday to have a use-of-force expert testify at trial for Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old accused of killing two people and injuring three others during a mob attack in Kenosha, Wis., last month. Prosecutors asked that the expert examine Rittenhouse's handling of the weapons used in the incident, including an officer's gun, as evidence in the case against the teenager. The request was denied Tuesday in a brief ruling by Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to three charges of first-degree murder, manslaughter and a fourth charge of criminal mischief . Schroeder said prosecutors must submit a written request in a pretrial hearing on Oct. 21 to show how to prove Rittenhouse's motive. The case against him will start on Nov. 1. Authorities said Kyle Rittenhouse fired several rounds at people during a mob attack last month, killing one man and injuring two women . At the time of the attack, the Rittenhouse Police Department was preparing to defend itself in response to a white supremacist rally that was being held in downtown Kenosha. The officers were defending themselves and their equipment, prosecutors said. The Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder's ruling Tuesday denied the defense's request . Schroeder rejected the defense request Tuesday . He said the request was without merit, noting that the experts have already given evidence of Rittenhouse's actions in the police department during his time there and in training . Schroeder ruled on Tuesday that the prosecutors must show how they can prove Rittenhouse's motive in a pre-trial hearing scheduled for Oct. 21. If there is no evidence of Rittenhouse's motive, the case could be dismissed, Schroeder said . The judge also rejected the defense's request to introduce evidence about one of the victims that was later found in Rittenhouse's possession ."}

Last week's case has sparked debate in the United States about whether racism in the U.S. justice system has been a serious problem for years. Scroll down for video\n\nThis week, the issue was brought to the forefront as Kyle Rittenhouse was convicted of murder in what happened in Tuscon, Ariz. The 18-year-old white male was convicted in the deaths of two police officers. His supporters were outraged, while the police officer's family and critics of racism in the justice system called for Rittenhouse to be judged based on his actions, not his race. In response to the Rittenhouse verdict this week, we have written an opinion piece that discusses how the justice system in Connecticut is biased against black and brown youth.\n\nThis article is about the issue for Connecticut, not for the U.S. as a whole. We have done a lot of research into this issue and find the following to be fact:\n\nRittenhouse was convicted because of racism in the justice system\n\nIn a state with high incarceration rates for incarcerated youth of color in particular, the sentencing of white defendants has been disproportionately affected.\n\nIn 2016, Rittenhouse was sentenced to two years in prison for trespassing. A year later, after serving time in jail, he was arrested and charged with attempted murder for the shootings of two police officers in August. Rittenhouse was acquitted of that charge by a unanimous jury. In 2018, Rittenhouse was convicted of murder in the deaths of the two police officers in Tuscon, Ariz. In addition to the racial bias against Rittenhouse, there are a lot of biases against youth of color in general in Connecticut that we would like to discuss.\n\nRittenhouse's acquittal of attempted murder sparked the racial justice movement. This movement has highlighted the injustices that black and brown youths face throughout the world. In Connecticut, the situation is even worse than it is in other states. The following are just a few of the issues we are highlighting in this report. There are a number of problems with the justice system in Connecticut that Rittenhouse has highlighted, and we think the Rittenhouse movement is an important one. But we want to go further. We need to focus our attention on how racism affects the Connecticut community as a whole. There is a long history of racism in the state, and this racism has not changed over the years. Connecticut is one of the most racially segregated states in the U.S. and the rate of poverty among black and brown people is much higher than it is among white people."}

It has touched on divisive issues like gun rights, police brutality, and racial injustice.

Rittenhouse, 18, claimed self-defense after fatally shooting two men and wounding a third during protests in Kenosha on Aug. 21.

How does it make a difference to your opinion about this case? Two months after Rittenhouse's arrest, the media has continued to paint him in a bad light. In a recent column for The New York Times, columnist Laura Rozen wrote:\n\nAs Kyle Rittenhouse stood in court, the prosecutor and defense attorneys made starkly different interpretations of what it meant to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when he opened fire on the men. The prosecution argued that Kyle Rittenhouse should have taken a different path. That he had acted in self-defense when he killed two people and wounded a third. But Kyle Rittenhouse's defense attorneys, led by Kyle Rittenhouse's mother, focused on the possibility that there was another man present who could have been responsible. The trial was not about who fired the shots. Instead, it was about whether he did in fact act in self-defense. Rittenhouse's defense lawyers, meanwhile, have been making a similar argument on the media side. In the past few days, Kyle Rittenhouse's defense lawyer, Bryan Cave, has been telling the media that he is \"shocked\" to see the coverage of the Rittenhouse trial being so unfavorable to Rittenhouse. \"That is the way you get a guy who didn't do it to be viewed as a murderer,\" Cave said during a news conference in early September. \"You have to find the guy that did it, and you have to find him and you have to hold that person responsible.\" The Rittenhouse murder trial was an opportunity to examine the First and Second Amendments. It was also a chance to give Kyle Rittenhouse a fair shot at telling his side. The media should not be afraid to get involved. All we want to know is who did it and why. This is not about Kyle Rittenhouse's innocence or guilt, and neither is it about the media's credibility. It is an important question that should be answered. Both sides are entitled to a fair trial. We all want to know what was true and what the facts were in the Kyle Rittenhouse murder case. The media should not shy away from the hard truths and the hard questions that will be asked at Rittenhouse's trial. The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse is not over. The media must continue to play a role. This will be one of the toughest, most important and longest-running trials to have taken place in recent American history."}

The defendant's lawyer might make it a point to get the suspect to plead guilty, even if it means he won't be given a fair trial. But in recent years, a growing number of defendants are choosing to take the stand in such high-profile cases as Jussie Smollett and Kim Potter, and they are winning. Why are defendants choosing to take the stand in high-profile trials? And is social media playing a role? Alan Tuerkheimer explains. Jussie Smollett, Kim Potter, Travis McMichael, Elizabeth Holmes, and Potter herself have all taken the stand in recent high-profile trials, and won. Jussie Smollett went on trial last year for allegedly attacking a gay man in Chicago, and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. He has since been sentenced and will likely be imprisoned for a few years. Kim Potter's testimony against her ex-boyfriend, Kyle Rittenhouse, led to the former's conviction in the fatal shooting of two protesters. And Elizabeth Holmes has been found guilty of fabricating the origin of a patent she claimed was worth $300 million. Tuerkheimer says that a shift in the lawyers' views on how defendants should be treated is one of the main reasons for their growing willingness to testify. Many lawyers have changed their opinions about defendants taking the stand, and are more open to cases where the public can see that a defendant has been treated unfairly, he says. They also want to ensure that they have the opportunity to present new evidence, as in the case of Holmes. But social media also plays a role in these trials. According to Tuerkheimer, many jurors and jurors tend to expect defendants to testify, and in order to avoid being disqualified from the trial, defendants are often more willing to step up and testify than in the past. Jussie Smollett and others have used social media to call attention to their cases, and that has encouraged defendants to stand up. Tuerkheimer is still skeptical about whether social media will make a significant change in how defendants are treated in the future. This doesn't mean defendants can't take the stand in low-profile cases, Tuerkheimer says, but they may choose to plead guilty instead. If a jury believes the defendant has been treated unfairly, they may still be willing to take the stand."}

The protesters chanted her name and demanded justice for her murder. Kenosha is a community that has fought for racial justice for years. Last year, residents rallied against the police department and the community became more aware of Kizer's case after her body was discovered late last month. After the jury found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all charges, protesters rallied in support of Rittenhouse and Kizer, as well as other victims and survivors of violence. Chrystul Kizer died after being raped in her home in Kenosha, Wisc., in September. Her death was the subject of an investigative report by the Warnock Center for Human Rights. The Center called Kizer's death a \"savage act of sexual aggression.\" Kyle Rittenhouse, a high school student at the time, is charged in Kenosha's police shooting deaths of Jacob Blake, 25, and Blake's son, Kaydlin, 2. Both men were shot multiple times in the back while they stood in their vehicles during a peaceful protest in August. Rittenhouse has been in custody since then and is being held without bail. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to three counts of aggravated assault and one count of battery. Police say Rittenhouse shot and killed Kizer because he saw her with her boyfriend in Kenosha, Wis., after she was released from prison in September. The district attorney's office is appealing the murder conviction against Kyle Rittenhouse. The Kenosha Innocence Project, a legal advocacy group, is working to get Rittenhouse released from custody.

The incidents have taken place over the past two weeks in and around Waterford, in the Detroit suburb of Pontiac, police said. These charges stem from threats made online and at school, including one case in which children as young as 9 allegedly wrote a threatening letter to their high school principal, according to police. Two of those accused of creating threatening letters, both 9, were detained Thursday, police said, the Detroit News reported Friday. Police in the Pontiac suburb of Oxford arrested a 10-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl on Friday for allegedly making threats against schools. Both were in detention pending an arraignment, police in the suburb of Pontiac said. In Waterford, four students who have been accused of making serious threats against schools were taken into custody Thursday and Friday, Michigan State Police said. They were all in the eighth grade and nine years old. School officials in Oxford said they would not comment on the arrests and detention of students, but they noted that the school district is working closely with law enforcement and the courts to help those accused. The threat of violence against schools has become rampant in the nation recently, and some of the incidents have led authorities to detain students in the hope that they will rethink their actions and reconsider their threats. In metro Detroit, a total of two dozen students have been arrested and charged in recent days, according to authorities. Many of the threats against schools in Michigan appear to have been based on incidents of copycat violence against schools elsewhere in the U.S., according to officials. Authorities are warning parents that their children may face consequences if they carry out threats against schools even in jest."}

The press release for the event notes, \"Auburn Hills is a town of some 13,000 that is served by the Fort Smith hospital, which is the only hospital in the city.\" Bass Pro Shop, a popular fishing and hunting equipment retailer, is also a gun store. The news comes as a reminder of the controversy surrounding mass shootings and blood donation. Last year in New York City and Chicago, gun owners and advocates criticized mass blood drive events that were held in their respective neighborhoods. The group Gun Violence Archive, which tracks gun violence in the U.S., says there have been more than 200 mass shootings in the U.S. this year, the most in at least eight years. While there are blood drive events across the country hosted by nonprofits and local hospitals, there is concern that, for many people, they are inconvenient and they have to drive to locations far from where they work or where they live. Critics say blood drive events provide a false sense of safety and make it easier for people to purchase guns online.\n\nArkansas blood drive is held near gun store parking lot, where sales of guns similar to those used in school shooting are conducted. Photo provided by Bass Pro Shop\n\nFor example, the gun store at Bass Pro Shop sells a .45-caliber semi-automatic rifle, which is similar to the one used in the Auburn Hills school shooting, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The .45-caliber semi-automatic rifle, similar to one used in Auburn Hills shooting, can be purchased from Bass Pro Shop. The FBI is investigating the Auburn Hills school shooting, which killed at least 24 students, teachers and staff. Gun violence continues to be a growing problem across the U.S., according to Gun Violence Archive."}

This is not to say that Hollywood should be held responsible for any fatalities that happen on film set, but they should be held accountable for these shootings. These shootings occurred in two very different countries, yet the similarities are alarming. Let's start with the similarities: Both Brandon Lee and Halyna Hutchins were working on film and television projects when they were killed. The incidents were both accidental and neither shooting was premeditated, the FBI and USADA are saying. However, they did happen on sets that should be safe to work in. Both Brandon Lee and Halyna Hutchins were working on projects at film studios in the U.S. Both of the shooters were unarmed when they were killed. In both shootings, a piece of ammunition was found in the shotgun used by the shooter, either in the magazine, in the firearm, or in the grip of the shooter. Both shooters were mentally ill when they were killed. Brandon Lee was killed in a shooting at a Hollywood film set in 1993, while Hutchins was killed in a shooting at a Texas film set in 2021. Both shooters used guns that were supposed to be safe and functional, but that did not stop them from carrying out the murderous actions. In both shootings, the FBI and USADA say that the shooters were not properly screened for firearms and mental health. And both shooters died on film sets that were supposed to be safe places of work. What is interesting, however, is that the two incidents happened in different countries. While Brandon Lee died in 1993 in the U.S., Halyna Hutchins was killed in 2021 in Texas, USA. In both instances, the shooters were unarmed and the film set should have been safe places of work. Both were mentally ill when they died, the FBI and USADA are saying. However, Brandon Lee died on a U.S. movie set, while Halyna Hutchins was killed in Texas on a Texas movie set. There is no way to know if Brandon Lee died in a tragic accident or premeditated murder, but we know that he was killed on a U.S. film set. Halyna Hutchins was killed on a Texas film set, but that is the only information we have on her death. Both shooters were mentally ill when they died, and both deaths occurred on film sets in different countries."}

The move came in response to an increase in violence on the set of the hit ABC drama, where one star was killed while filming the second episode of the season four premiere last month. The showrunners of 'The Rookie', which is currently airing on ABC, sent out a letter last week to the cast and crew of the hit show, explaining the move, and now the guns have changed, reports the New York Daily News. The decision to change the guns came after a shooting on the show's 'Rust' set in Oklahoma City last month where Halyna Hutchins, 21, was killed while shooting a prop replica of an AK-47 assault rifle. The change was influenced by the incident, in which a gunman opened fire on the set of the hit ABC drama on May 19. The new guns were designed to be completely safe, and the use of live ammunition was banned in all episodes. Ben Simmons, who is a weapons expert and lecturer on the UCLA Anderson School of Management's Center for Law and Society, said that airsoft guns were classified in the same way as fake, deactivated, and real firearms when it came to weaponry.

The organization also works to educate the public about the dangers of purchasing firearms. Their new article on the movie Alec Baldwin in the movie The Wolf of Wall Street shines a spotlight on the dangerous nature of firearms used in movies and the dangers that are often not taken seriously on film sets. SOFREP Journalist: Hannah Gutierrez Reed is a head armer in Alec Baldwin's movie \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" which released last week, but she has very little experience with firearms. She was not trained or licensed to handle them, and she has only seen animals shot with guns on film sets before. The Wolf of Wall Street director Martin Scorsese said he did not know about her lack of training or licensing, but SOFREP thinks that's too convenient. These films glorify the use of firearms, making it seem easy and natural to shoot people. There is a very close relationship between Hollywood and the firearms industry, and it is just as easy to blame them as the actors themselves. Alec Baldwin himself is not responsible for the lack of training or licensing for Hannah Gutierrez Reed, so he should stop blaming her.\n\nThe movie The Wolf of Wall Street is based on the true story of mobster Frank Lucas. He was shot in the chest by an assassin in 1960. Frank Lucas was shot after refusing to cooperate with the mobsters, so SOFREP is asking the public not to be like Frank Lucas and not give in to pressure from movie companies. The movie shows Lucas as a victim, and SOFREP's article says the movie is making him seem like a victim who could be killed any day, no matter what actions he took.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the movie is the language used. The Wolf of Wall Street was censored by the FBI for using the word \"assassinate\" in place of \"burned\" in order to make the movie look more realistic. The FBI decided the film was too close to the true story of Frank Lucas. It also censored the movie for using the word \"assault\" in place of \"attack.\" The FBI felt it was wrong to glorify violence in the movie. The Wolf of Wall Street also used the word \"choke,\" which is considered a form of assault in the movie, but it's not a form of assault according to SOFREP. SOFREP is calling for a ban on the use of \"assault\" in movies, as well as a ban on \"assault\" as a verb. There should also be a ban on \"attack.\""}

A similar incident last month during the filming of an American film in New York left a man dead and two injured.

Israel has a unique culture of firearm security, including mandatory military conscription for men, a culture that has resulted in a greater familiarity with firearms and increased respect for firearms among Israeli filmmakers. It is no coincidence that Israelis have been shooting with prop guns for many years, and the Israeli film industry believes such an incident could not have occurred in Israel.

The last time I was on the set of 'Rust', which was shot on the same day as the shooting, we were lucky to get out without being injured and the day was full of fun, and to my knowledge other members of SNL, the cast, crew, and other filmmakers in the area were having a great time as well. I am a union prop master with a background in film and television production for 20 years and have worked in some of the most challenging, dangerous and stressful jobs in the business - I know the value of staying safe and feeling empowered as a team. Roughly 15 minutes after we left the set of 'Rust', we heard news that a shooting was taking place at the set of the film. Before I knew it, I heard about the injuries sustained by the director Joel Souza and Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. We all knew that Alec Baldwin was drunk, and we were all shocked and saddened by what happened to this young man, who was supposed to be responsible for the safety of everyone in the film, including himself. A few days later, it was revealed that there were more than 12 rounds of bullets that Alec...

Stimulus payments are sent electronically by the IRS. The payments are being made in the same way that recipients receive their regular Social Security benefits, most often electronically. This means you can expect your payment if you qualified, even if you missed the deadline to file your 2020 tax return, because the IRS will use your information if you don't have a valid 2019 or 2020 tax return. Here are a few things you should know about the stimulus payment: What's next for seniors? As of April 7, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has identified nearly 1 million seniors who don't have valid 2019 or 2020 tax returns. As of the same time, the SSA had collected information on more than 1.7 million households that have seniors on their Social Security benefits who didn't file a 2019 or 2020 tax return. The vast majority of seniors who didn't file their taxes are getting their stimulus checks, according to the IRS. But there is no guarantee that you will receive the stimulus payment even if you didn't file a tax return for 2019 or 2020, because the IRS will only use your information if you don't have a valid 2019 or 2020 tax return. It's still possible to apply for other stimulus payments if you qualify. You can expect your payment when you receive your regular Social Security benefits, most often electronically. If you don't know when your regular Social Security payments will begin, visit the Social Security Administration's web page to get the latest information on your retirement benefits or call them at 1-800-772-1213. What do veterans need to do? Veterans who qualify for the stimulus payments need to have valid 2019 or 2020 Social Security returns. If they do, the IRS will send the payment to them electronically. If you have questions about whether you qualify for the stimulus payment, you can call the Social Security Administration's Veterans Administration (1-800-772-1213), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (1-800-829-8787) or the IRS (1-800-857-1040).

We are here to help. The $2 trillion American Rescue Plan contains more than $1.9 trillion in additional economic relief for Americans to help them through the pandemic. That includes a second round of $900 billion in aid for the American people, the first phase of which was sent out last week. Some stimulus payments, such as the first set of checks, are taxed as a tax rebate while others are paid as stimulus checks. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a special type of stimulus payment that gives money to those who didn't receive their stimulus checks last week. The Recovery Rebate Credit can be used to pay off some debts like back taxes and child support. A Treasury Offset Program gives a discount to your tax refund if certain debts are paid back. This means you may have less to pay back on top of your stimulus check. As of February 28th, you still have time to apply for and receive a Recovery Rebate Credit. You do not need to file your federal tax return for this to happen. Apply at https://www.irs.gov/apply-for-recovery-rebate-credit or call (800) 392-7613 if you have questions. Here is an example of how your recovery rebate credit would look on your federal tax return: If you received $13,000 in stimulus checks, you would need to file a federal tax return and use the Recovery Rebate Credit to pay back back taxes and child support. In some cases, you may receive your Recovery Rebate Credit as a credit on your federal federal tax return. In that case, you could get a bigger tax rebate, depending on the size of your state tax return and income. If you receive your Recovery Rebate Credit as a credit on your federal federal tax return, you can pay it back through the Treasury Offset program. The Treasury Offset Program works with the IRS to give you a discount on your tax refund. This is a savings of hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year. Here is an example of how a recovery rebate credit would look on your federal tax return: If you received $13,000 in stimulus checks, you would need to file a federal tax return.

But what impact will the bill have on the finances of US families? The US Senate passed its third stimulus bill, which contains a $1,400 per adult and $600 per child check. But will this have any effect on household financial stability? This is an analysis of how the new stimulus package will impact households. By John CampbellBusiness and finance editor, Morning Consult As a journalist writing about the economy, I find the focus of political debate and economic commentary on the third stimulus bill to be a bit of a surprise. While the overall size and timing of the bill is good, the lack of data on the impact on households' ability to pay their bills has been striking, as have some of the policy suggestions contained in the bill. When the US Senate passed its first $2 trillion bill in 2009, the debate raged for months over the impact on household finances and consumer spending, including the role of student loans and the potential impact of the massive tax cut. Of course we all liked it when the student loans were forgiven, but that is not the point. What is interesting to note is that when we looked at the financial situation of US families, we saw that it was not the most popular bill, despite the amount it was spent. This is because at that time, there was limited data on the financial situation of US families. This time around, there has been even more focus on the impact of the stimulus package on consumer spending. That is a bit of a surprise, in my view, given that traditional economic data like the GDP and consumer spending data do not provide a full picture of the distribution of savings among the US population. So let's look at the data from one of the most comprehensive sources we have - Morning Consult. It tracks all aspects of the US household finances and its tracking data includes all three stimulus packages in addition to all of the other economic policies in the past 20 years. So let's look at the distribution of savings among the US households. We looked at two different scenarios: first, let's assume we are on a recovery, with the economy growing and consumer spending rising, and second, let's look at an economic downturn. So let's assume that we are on a recovery, with the economy growing and... 1. This time around, there has been even more focus on the impact of the stimulus package on consumer spending.

Some states are now offering their own stimulus payments, but others, including California, have decided not to do so The pandemic has seen an increase in housing and food insecurity in the US, partly due to the loss of employment caused by the shutdowns. Stimulus payments have been a crucial lifeline for many low income American families who are struggling with the crisis caused by the virus. The American public is not likely to receive another round of stimulus payments until 2021 at the earliest. There is no anticipation of a fourth round of federal stimulus payments for the general American public, US media outlet Forbes reports. Several states, including California, New York, New Mexico, Maryland, and Colorado, have already started offering their own stimulus payments, but others, including Texas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Georgia, are not doing so. Lawmakers are focusing on other forms of financial support such as child tax credit payments rather than direct payments.

Instead, most of the checks being distributed in this round will be smaller and more targeted to individuals who already qualify for them. These include: . 2. States Providing Additional Financial Relief Some states are already providing additional financial relief due to the gap in federal support, with millions of California receiving a second Golden State Stimulus check of $600 to $1,100, per CNN . The state of California, for instance, is providing another round of $600 to $1,100 checks to those individuals who have not already qualified. These individuals will receive a second round of $600 checks, an additional $300 per child if they have a child, and $300 if they have two or more children. These amounts will gradually increase as the child gets older, to $1,200 per child from age three to age 12. 3. Low-income Marylanders Eligible for Direct Payments Marylanders will be eligible for direct payments of $300 or $500 . Those eligible will begin receiving the payments starting this week . These payments will be available through December, with future aid discussed in federal budget packages . The state will also be offering $150 per household for those who are struggling to pay for rent, if they qualify. 4. Advance Monthly Child Tax Credit Payments of Up to $300 per Child Advance monthly child tax credit payments of up to $300 per child continue through December .

But with the economy improving and unemployment claims down sharply, it looks increasingly unlikely that Congress or President Trump will give Americans a fourth stimulus check at this time. The White House released its weekly unemployment claims report on Tuesday and indicated the number of Americans claiming unemployment insurance fell by 2.2 million in August, the highest drop since April. While that is a much bigger drop than the 12.7 million who applied for unemployment in August, it is still only 12% of the total number of Americans unemployed during the same month. While the economy appears to be getting back in gear, many are still craving a second stimulus check from the White House or Congress to help pay their bills. That's why over 2.8 million Americans have signed a petition for a $2,000 monthly stimulus payment that would be paid out for three months in a row. \"We need this now,\" Change.org petition creator Stephanie Bonin told USA Today. \"We are at a critical time, and it's so important to make sure the stimulus checks get in to the hands of those most in need.\" Bonin pointed out the importance of getting the stimulus check to the people who need it most. In the United States, 2 million more people applied for unemployment insurance in August than in July. Bonin said the reason for the jump is because many Americans had to stop working to care for elderly family members or sick family members during the pandemic."}

However, the \"plus-up\" has caused confusion for millions of Americans who need to know why they are getting a payment in their bank account. The news media is reporting that some families will receive a second payment of $1,400 in the form of a child tax credit. This is correct, however the details of how many families will receive this are not yet known. This is due to the fact that the details of CTC payments are determined after the US census is taken in October of this year, and it is only after that that we will know how many families will receive these payments and how much they will be. This means that the first round of payments will be made in November and the second round will be paid out in February of 2021. The purpose of these payments is to address the impacts of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. This is not the first time that the Child Tax Credit has been subject to a \"plus-up\" but this has been part of the child tax credit for some time now and has been called the \"plus-up\" since 2008. However the new American Rescue Plan that was unveiled in September of this year has added to these payments. The \"plus-up\" is triggered when a family has a lower income than they used to, or when they have a child. The details of how the \"plus-up\" works will be explained in the next section of this story. It will be announced after the census is taken in October of 2021. It is also important to note that it is not always necessary to receive a \"plus-up\" payment. The amount of money that you will get will be determined based on your own income level and whether you have children. The new American Rescue Plan will be unveiled in September 2021. The CTC was a huge part of the Rescue Plan, but there are also \"plus-up\" payments being made to some of the American families. This is the second biggest part of the plan.

That chamber is expected to approve it on Monday and President Trump will sign it into law. What are the arguments behind the Senate vote? In a statement, Bill Cassidy accused Democrats of trying to use the coronavirus pandemic to increase taxes and punish hardworking Americans.

In a statement, Tom Cotton said that the proposed amendment would have been \"the most unfair law ever passed in this country.\" He said that while many prisoners haven't lost their jobs due to the pandemic, it would disproportionately harm children of color and prisoners who are more likely to have preexisting conditions like asthma or diabetes.

Joe Biden, who was sworn in as president in January, signed a $900 billion relief package in March aimed at easing the effects of the pandemic on Americans. In that package, he included stimulus payments for Americans of up to $2000 for each adult and $1000 for children to be sent in between April and December. More than 100 million Americans are now claiming the payments. The stimulus payments are now part of the next round of relief from the pandemic. Democrats and Republicans are debating a fourth round of stimulus money that may be sent out over the next six months. Here's what you need to know about it. The idea is to expand the child tax credit so that parents can pay more for childcare for their children and for higher education. That expansion was part of the first stimulus bill.

Now, many states are extending that help to people who've lost their jobs as the virus has continued to spread. The child tax credit was expanded to make the payments more affordable. Joe Biden signed a $900 billion coronavirus relief package in March to boost the economy, but now the president-elect is weighing in with some more relief for Americans. Here, the president-elect weighs in, offering another round of stimulus payments, this time to boost childcare in the middle and lower classes. The president-elect also wants to give families a $10,000 credit for each child they have, though he could lose some of that money due to taxes and other expenses. The child tax credit expansion was part of the first stimulus bill. On Thursday, Democrats and Republicans are in talks about a new round of relief payments. The next stimulus bill would contain more money for low- and middle-class Americans by expanding the child tax credit, which is designed to boost child care and higher education. Here are some details. The federal government has already spent about $8 billion on stimulus checks so far, and the first round of payments ended in January. That was part of a $900 billion relief package signed by President Joe Biden in March to combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

On Friday, Sheriff Alex Villanueva released information about the crash, including a copy of his criminal complaint, which states there was no evidence to support his initial assessment that it was an accident. Experts say that the absence of braking and steering evidence, along with Woods' reported memory loss about how the crash occurred and his inability to explain the crash, could all indicate that Woods was impaired during the accident, and should be tested for impairment. The attorney for Woods, Mark Steinberg, has said the former world number one would not consent to such a DRE assessment. It is the first time a DRE has attempted to be admitted into the Tiger Woods car crash case, according to news accounts. DRE's usually work in criminal cases, such as drug offenses or DUI (driving under the influence) cases, where impaired driving is a primary concern. At this point, it is unclear whether the evidence will lead to DRE's being admitted to the car crash case."}

In a statement, Alex Villanueva, LA County Sheriff, said there was 'no evidence of impairment' in Tiger Woods' SUV. The LA Times quotes him as saying, \"We have no cause of the crash as of yet.\"\n\nIn an effort to make the story more dramatic, authorities have tried to make it look like the SUV crashed through a fence and ended up in a wooded area. While the Sheriff's Department acknowledges that there was a fence that was hit in the crash, Woods' car was partially submerged in water and he was found sitting on the ground outside of his SUV a few blocks away, according to the Times.\n\nIn the statement, the Sheriff's Department said that the crash was an accident because of what they call 'impairment of consciousness.' That means a driver must not be able to remember what happened to him, according to CNN. The statement even says that the crash was due to \"a sudden change in roadway conditions, resulting in a loss of control of the SUV.\"\n\nThe statement also says there is \"no cause of the crash as of yet,\" which again makes it seem as if the incident was completely out of Woods' control and the authorities are just trying to make a dramatic statement that the crash was not intentional.\n\nThis is a very unethical way to go about investigating a possible crime. Experts say that if a driver is driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they would have a harder time remembering what happened to them. It makes it even more difficult to determine whether or not a person was driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, especially when they were unconscious.\n\nAs the Sheriff's Dept. continues to try to make this crash a tragic accident, it does little to help the public. Instead of focusing on what caused the crash and trying to help Tiger Woods and his family deal with the aftermath, the Sheriff's Dept. seems to be focusing on what happened to Tiger's SUV and trying to paint Tiger as the one who caused a crash that he clearly wasn't at fault for.\n\nExperts say they are frustrated with the LA County Sheriff's Department's lack of transparency. They are also upset that there has been little publicity about the case, especially since they say that the lack of transparency is due to authorities' attempts to make this crash seem more dramatic than it actually was."}

It will also be one of the most important for the Rams, if they are able to overcome the adversity caused by the recent trade that cost them their first-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. It is one of the most intriguing matchups of the 2015 NFL season. Tampa Bay has been one of the most impressive teams in recent years, winning two straight Super Bowls — the first time for any team in NFL history to do so. Meanwhile, the LA Rams have been inconsistent, losing four of their last five games, including three to the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers. It has been a hard time for the LA Rams, with a major disappointment in their most recent trade, losing their first-round pick to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2016 NFL Draft. Before the 2015 NFL season started, it looked as if the Los Angeles Rams would be a team that would challenge the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers for championships. However, the Los Angeles Rams are a struggling team. They won one of their first five games of the 2015 NFL season by defeating the New England Patriots, but the remainder of their season has been a struggle. This matchup will be the third of the season between the two quarterbacks, the second to be played at Levi's Stadium. In the first two meetings between the two teams, neither of the teams won. The first meeting took place in Super Bowl XLVIII, where the Tampa Bay Bucs beat the LA Rams 38-24, led by Tom Brady. The second encounter was in Super Bowl XLIX, where the LA Rams held the Tampa Bay Bucs to a 14-14 tie, with both teams scoring 24 points in the third quarter of the game. The Los Angeles Rams were a disappointing team in 2015, losing four of their last five games. The Rams will want to turn things around in their next game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, despite having lost their first-round pick in the 2016 NFL draft. Matthew Stafford has struggled in recent games against the Tampa Bay Bucs."}

So he was unable to calculate the exact likelihood of Brady winning seven or more Super Bowls with his current deal with Bayern Munich.

The Republican-led Senate failed to remove Donald Trump from office in February, just days before the coronavirus pandemic began spreading in the US. This week, Trump took a series of aggressive actions to try and stop the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Here is how Trump and his actions are viewed by the legal community, and what the legal system can and cannot do about this situation. We are living in unprecedented times, where the global community is grappling with the spread of the new coronavirus, a global health crisis of unprecedented proportions. In this context, it is difficult to consider other issues besides the immediate threat of this disease. But the recent unfolding of events in the US, the actions of Donald Trump, and the responses of the legal system to these actions should not be overlooked as we try to get back to normal in our daily lives. For example, the impeachment vote in the US House of Representative in December 2019, which removed Donald Trump from office, served a number of important purposes. First, it forced the president-elect to delay the inauguration of President Trump. Second, it provided a chance for lawmakers to question the president-elect and former vice president Joe Biden about their actions during the campaign. Third, it provided a chance for the US and the world to watch President Trump as he was impeached, a process in which the former president-elect was a central figure. It is difficult to see how this process was possible without Trump's complicity. What can the US Supreme Court do about Trump's actions? The high court's role is to interpret the Constitution, which the US Congress has passed in 1789. However, under US law, the Supreme Court cannot punish or remove a president-elect from office, even if that president is impeached and removed from office. It is not clear what the Supreme Court could do to punish Trump for the illegal actions he has taken. For example, the Supreme Court could refuse to allow President Trump to participate in the 2021 inauguration ceremony. President Trump's actions reflect a pattern of manipulating electoral outcomes.

President Trump is the second U.S. president to be impeached, and the ACLU argues that impeachment is the correct way to remove an executive official for abuse of office. Across the country, many people have been protesting and supporting impeachment of the president, and the ACLU supports those efforts for political and moral reasons. The president's impeachment request has been approved by the ACLU board of directors. The president is a public employee who, by virtue of his position, must abide by the rules that govern speech in the public interest. As such, this impeachment request can only be based on actions taken in the course of his public office. President Trump's speech does not violate the First Amendment. As a public servant he cannot be sanctioned for speech, no more than any other public official. The ACLU's position is supported in part by the fact that impeachment was used in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson for the murder of Ulysses S. Grant in 1865. Johnson was not a member of the executive branch, and he did not speak for the U.S. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson followed an investigation by congressional committees and an indictment of the President of Murder. Both Andrew Johnson and Trump are public officials who have abused their positions, and the actions of both men, including Trump's speech on Jan. 6, justify impeachment. The ACLU believes it is appropriate to remove the president from office so that he can be tried for the offenses of impeachment."}

In less than 12 months, he and his administration have had more than their share of controversies, but the most significant have been the impeachment proceedings against him, which led to his removal from office, and the coronavirus pandemic, which led to the first economic shutdown of U.S. history. With that said, there have been plenty of other things to talk about during his final months in office, so here are the five biggest stories that have dominated the news during his presidency. 1. Impeachment proceedings led to Trump's removal from office After the first debate, Trump's campaign repeatedly claimed the results had been rigged and he would win the election by a landslide if it were decided based on votes from the popular vote, rather than the electoral college. In October 2016, Donald Trump was elected president in the first U.S. presidential election in a generation to be decided by vote from the electoral college, which is based on votes from each state. In January 2017, the Republican took office after winning 270 electoral college votes over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. During his final months in office, Trump was removed from office twice for breaching U.S. impeachment proceedings. He was charged with obstructing Congress, which led to him being impeached for the second time in December 2019, and a third time in February 2020. Both times he was found guilty of the offence, and the House of Representatives voted to send his case to the Senate, where he faces a second trial. 2. Coronavirus outbreak led to the first economic shutdown of U.S. history On March 27, 2020, President Trump declared the U.S. was at a public health emergency due to coronavirus and called on people to stay at home. The order came three days after the first person in the U.S. tested positive for the virus. By March 30, more than 25,000 people in the U.S. had tested positive for the virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By May, nearly 1 million people in the U.S. had tested positive for the virus and the U.S. had become the worst-hit country by number of cases. In April, the first death due to coronavirus was reported in the U.S. The number of cases in the U.S. increased by more than 600% by the end of April and more than 300% by the end of May. 3. Trump's successor Joe Biden was inaugurated on January 20 On January 20, Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president. The inauguration was the first to be held without Trump in the White House for nearly 20 years."}

The group of Republicans who voted to impeach President Trump on Thursday is a small minority of his party, but that does not mean they represent the whole of the GOP . And their actions, as well as those of their Democrat and conservative backers, will help set the stage for Donald Trump to be removed from office . (Associated Press)\n\nRepublicans face an uphill battle to oust Trump from the presidency because the majority of their party will likely be against him. But the vote by 10 Republicans to impeach Trump on Thursday is a victory for democracy and a significant step in the right direction. And it should provide Republicans with a new sense of momentum to get the impeachment proceedings through the Senate and force Trump to step down as president. The vote by some of Trump's allies to impeach him is a vote of conscience, and a victory for democracy, and their actions and those of their Democrat and conservative backers will help set the stage for Donald Trump to be removed from office.\n\nThe vote by 10 Republicans is a small minority of the GOP. The party may be in turmoil as Trump fights his second impeachment, but many GOP senators who voted to impeach Trump and put him on trial did so out of a sense of duty, not ideology. They saw themselves as defending the Constitution and the rule of law. Many Republicans believe impeachment will be an effective way to remove Trump, and they hope the process will eventually result in the president's removal from office. But this is unlikely to happen unless more Republicans join the majority of Democrats in supporting impeachment.\n\nEven before the vote, some GOP leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appeared to acknowledge this. He has said that the party needs to address divisiveness, change how it runs the party, and that the GOP cannot always rely on Trump's rallies to push issues. If McConnell and other GOP leaders want to see a change in the party after the election, they'll need to start listening more to what the young conservative activists want and working toward that goal, as well as listening more to their conservative base.\n\nThe impeachment vote should help GOP turn the page on Trump, and help the party move forward.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have been working toward the same goal for months now. Their actions will set the tone for the post-Trump era and help push impeachment ahead. And, again, if McConnell and other GOP leaders want to move the party forward, they will need to turn the page on Trump.\n\n..."}

President Donald Trump tweeted a message congratulating his supporters for coming to Washington, DC for the historic event. However, he was subsequently suspended on all of his social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The Trump campaign has refused to concede the election, even as a majority of Americans accept that he has lost. In the wake of the events of January 6 in the US Capitol, Twitter and other social media platforms suspended President Trump after he encouraged supporters to \"go to Washington, DC, and show force\". Many Americans have accused the President-elect of not acting swiftly enough to stop the violence. 61% of Americans agreed with the ban due to risks of further violence incitement, whereas 39% opposed it. Facebook also banned Trump at least until after President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, with the possibility of an indefinite ban.

Trump was banned from all major social media platforms, there was an immediate drop in the volume of his online messages. How has that changed since the ban was put in place? Have his supporters found alternative platforms that continue to support Trump? The New York Times is reporting the findings of a study that examines those questions. Facebook banned Trump from its site and other social media platforms on January 6 after violent protesters stormed the US Capitol. He is still banned from Twitter. Facebook extended the ban, which originally ran until January 15, for at least another 6 months in a statement released Monday, saying it will continue monitoring \"public safety concerns.\" Trump's ban appears to have increased the volume of Trump's political statements, but not necessarily to the level of before the ban began. Post-ban, some of Trump's statements have yet to reach pre-ban levels of engagement, according to analysis from the Center for Journalism at University of Central Florida. The ban also appears to have increased the number of social media users able to access Trump's messages without the fear of censorship, but that doesn't mean they read them. In fact, the analysis found that overall, the percentage of those messages read was almost the same as it was before the ban. The Trump administration on Monday announced a ban on the President's access to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Among other things, that means all messages Trump sends on these platforms will no longer be displayed in his Facebook and Instagram timelines, and his messages will not be able to be shared through Facebook and Instagram Stories. Trump has not yet responded to the order. Twitter, meanwhile, has said it will not allow Trump to share any more information on its platform. This article will be a companion piece to our story from last week, which examined how the president's social media ban had impacted his overall social media strategy.

Texas was the hardest hit, with up to 90% of its electricity lost for 14 hours, as winds gusting up to 70mph blew snow and ice across power lines. The Eastern United States was hit with ice and snow, causing millions of people to go without electricity. In El Paso, the city experienced minimal disruptions. By contrasting the two states' experiences of the storm, Texas Monthly takes a look at the differences in their power grids and the lessons El Paso should learn. El Paso Electric spent millions on winterizing its facilities, including the construction of the Montana Power Station with dual-fuel capability. This helped El Paso avoid major power outages, contrasting with the rest of Texas. In El Paso, the city experienced minimal disruptions, unlike most other Texas cities, which faced severe power outages. El Paso Electric spent millions on winterizing its facilities before the storm hit, which included the construction of a dual-fuel power plant. Across Texas, power outages forced people to turn on heaters, boil kettles and other sources of backup energy. The ice and snow caused power companies to cut power supply and customers to go without electricity for extended periods in some parts of Texas. El Paso's experience contrasted markedly with the rest of Texas. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), El Paso's winterization program and connection to the Western Interconnection grid helped it avoid major outages. In fact, El Paso's experience was the most favorable of all the U.S. cities affected by the storm. El Paso Electric spent millions on winterizing its facilities, including the construction of the Montana Power Station with dual-fuel capability, and its connection to the Western Interconnection grid. El Paso was one of the few U.S. cities, along with Portland, Oregon, to avoid major power failures during the storm, according to FEMA."}

It was the deadliest winter storm to hit Texas in 25 years, leaving many without power. The scientists who are studying climate change are divided on whether climate change could be making it more likely for extreme cold weather to hit the U.S. and other parts of the world. On one side, climate scientists say that rising temperatures have warmed the Arctic so that the polar ice is melting more easily. The melting ice in the polar regions has led to more severe weather events such as the cold snap in Texas. But experts on the other side of the fence say that warming in the Arctic isn't the reason for more extreme cold events. What are the implications of the extreme cold snap for the U.S. and the rest of the world? The cold snap in Texas caused massive energy demand spikes and blackouts in the state, which is the only state in the U.S. to have had a blackout on Saturday.

Winter Storm Uri has knocked out power to nearly three million Texans, left millions without heat, and caused billions of dollars worth of damage, according to the region's governor. Winter Storm Uri, which hit Texas last month with blizzard-style winds, was the first winter storm in more than a decade to hit the state with winds of at least 40 mph. And while the impact of Uri has subsided, another storm is heading in from the north. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warns Texas is most at risk, potentially facing a 37% energy shortfall, per Business Insider, which notes that this could leave residents in the state without power for months. While most of Texas is likely to be spared the kind of power outages experienced by the Northeast in recent years, the threat from the coming winter weather may not go away. \"We are aware of the situation in Texas and are working hard with our energy suppliers and regulators,\" NERC's executive vice president Mark Olson said in a statement. \"We are confident that our suppliers can take the necessary steps to mitigate this threat.\" The Texas A&M University hurricane expert said that after Winter Storm Uri, a second storm like this could come from the north, but that there was no evidence such a storm was on the horizon. He said the energy demand would be lower, so there would be no need for emergency generators. Aside from the potential for widespread power outages, the report from the NERC also comes on the heels of an uptick in the number of lawsuits being brought against the power company. Some of the lawsuits allege that the company, ERCOT, had a \"willful\" refusal to reduce the load on its lines, leaving some communities in Texas in the dark when the storm hit. \"We are confident that our suppliers can take the necessary steps to mitigate this threat,\" NERC's Olson said. \"We are confident in the resilience of our systems.\" (Click here to read about the billing issues faced by Texans after Winter Storm Uri.)"}

The cause of the power failure is not yet known, but it's clear that the state's power grid has not been this vulnerable in a long time. The storm's power failure devastated the Texas power grid, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power On February 21, Texas suffered a winter storm, followed by heavy ice and snow on February 22 and 23, which resulted in widespread power outages across the state. In the aftermath of the storm, more than 1,300 people were hospitalized, and 151 people were confirmed to have died. However, BuzzFeed's data review suggests that this could be a much higher number of fatalities, and an analysis by the Texas governor suggests that the death toll could be as high as four times that number. The Houston Chronicle ran an article with the headline, \"Lost power could be killing Texas residents.\" The headline caught the eye of BuzzFeed's data team and drove traffic to the article, leading to over half a million page views, over 200,000 unique visitors, and 4.1 million impressions in the first two days of the story on February 24 and 25. The original article is still available on the Chronicle's website. According to the Texas governor, more than 1,300 people were hospitalized with severe respiratory problems after the storm, which was followed by heavy ice and snow on February 22 and 23. No deaths had been confirmed at the time. On February 24 and 25, BuzzFeed's data team did a simple analysis. We used an \"excess fatalities\" analysis, comparing the number of deaths that happened during the storm week to those during normal conditions. Our analysis suggests that the February winter storm could have killed between 426 and 978 more people than normal. In fact, the exact number could be higher, because data on how many people are injured in accidents during the storm week does not yet exist. In the aftermath of the storm, 151 people were confirmed to have died. The data team also estimated that the storm week alone could have killed 702 people. The analysis is based on state records in the past decade, and we also looked at other states with similar weather, but without the same widespread power outages that occurred in Texas, to see if they had a spike in deaths. To do that, we analyzed data from each state over the past decade, looking for similar weather patterns to the one we saw in Texas. We found states that experienced similar weather patterns to Texas, but without widespread power outages, like Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Those states did not see a spike in deaths."}

In a settlement announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Tuesday night, Griddy Energy is to pay $2.5 million in damages to customers that received very high electricity bills during the storm. The bill was caused when the company offered consumers a 'wholesale electricity rate' to pay for high-priced power generated by the company's own nuclear plants. The agency sued the company after thousands of customers complained about bills ranging from $2,000 to $13,000. \"This settlement marks an important step forward in the fight to hold energy suppliers accountable,\" Attorney General Paxton said. The new settlement will prevent Griddy Energy from billing any of its Texas customers for any future power bills from the storm. In a statement to CNN, Griddy Energy said it \"remains committed to providing Texas with reliable, affordable energy for years to come\".

(NYSE:VIS) issued a new estimate for the cost of a recent winter storm Uri, which hit the Midwest earlier this year. The energy company raised the February estimate from $900 million to $1.3 billion, or an increase of 1,000 per cent. The winter storm Uri was the most severe to hit the Midwest in 25 years, the company said in a regulatory filing. The storm cost Vistra approximately $1.6 billion in January, when it raised that estimate to $1.3 billion, according to a regulatory filing. Vistra also revised its outlook for its 2021 EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. The company said it expects 2021 to see a revenue increase in the low single-digits, with EBITDA and free cash flow falling into the range of $1,475-$1,875 million and $200-$600 million respectively.

This is the third winter storm that has hit Texas in the space of a month, and has been named the most extreme to hit the state in more than a decade. It will also push the average temperature below freezing for the first time in nearly six decades, though not to as low as the winter of 1969-70. The rolling blackouts were announced Tuesday morning by the Southwest Power Pool, which oversees the distribution of electricity across Texas, Oklahoma, and some parts of Mexico. The Southwest Power Pool said Texas had no choice but to shut its main transmission lines, which account for more than two-thirds of the state's electricity production, in response to the severe winter storm. \"The power grid is down and we cannot restore power quickly enough to meet demand,\" Power Pool executive vice president and president of Texas, Paul Menchaca, told reporters. \"We're working as hard as we can, but we can't restore power on demand at this point.\" More than two million people were left in the dark across Texas, according to the power company Entergy. While the rolling blackouts caused some economic disruption for businesses, most of the impact came down to inconvenience for customers. \"It's going to take days, probably a week, for us not to be able to turn on our heaters. It's going to be cold, and it's going to be hard, but we've got to go through it,\" Travis County, Texas, fire chief Mike Smith said. The severe weather system that has hit Texas and parts of Oklahoma resulted in more than 3,000 power outages, with 2 million people in Texas without power Tuesday . The Texas Energy Office said the cold spell is the second-deepest recorded in the state . The severe weather system will lead to the lowest temperatures in Texas in more than half a century . Some 1 million people were affected by the severe weather system in the Southwest Power Pool system, which includes Texas, Oklahoma and parts of Mexico . More than 3,000 power outages were reported in Texas and over 3 million people were without power in Oklahoma . The severe weather system has led to the lowest temperatures ever recorded in Texas ."}

This would be the second largest budget in the history of Texas. (In 2013,\n\nthe winter weather caused Texas to spend $57 billion on fuel to power homes and businesses.)\n\nThe energy industry is calling for the winterization of their facilities to prevent more severe winter weather. More than 75% of Texans say they agree with this idea. But this is more likely to be seen as a symbolic action, rather than a practical one. A poll by the University of Texas at Austin shows that large majorities blame the lack of winterization of power and gas facilities (75%) and the unprecedented nature of the storm (68%) for its impact.\n\nEnergy providers in Texas have begun the process of winterization. For example, the Energy Department of Texas has started a project to winterize a gas pipeline that supplies gas to more than 1,000 Texan communities. And the federal government is investing in the winterization of natural gas and power plants in Texas. There are estimated to be about 2.5 billion gallons of natural gas stored in tank farms that could not be used because the facilities are not winterized. This could cause energy providers to lose millions of dollars if they had to sell the natural gas for a higher price. So the companies are working to winterize their facilities.\n\nThe energy providers are now planning to spend $60 billion to deal with the severe winter weather. This would be the second largest budget in the history of Texas. The Texas electric utility companies have already taken steps to winterize their facilities. For example, they will be installing more heating and cooling units in homes and businesses. The energy industry wants the government to help pay for the cost of winterization.\n\nThis is especially important because the Texas electricity..."}

An analysis of how residents coped in Harris County, the area most hit by the storm, found that many were forced to leave their homes due to the lack of hot water and electrical supply, making them more vulnerable to cold temperatures and illnesses like the flu. More than half of Harris County's residents said they lost access to hot water, compared with less than a quarter of Texas residents as a whole. Harris County has some of the highest rates of poverty in the state, with an estimated 36% of residents living below the poverty line, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

So what is known about her death? And what do we need to know about her homicide investigation? While authorities are investigating the death of Brian Laundrie, a man who died along with Petito on July 2, 2019, it is unclear what caused his death. Officials said the body was found by volunteers in Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park, Florida, located in Ocala, the weekend after Petito died. Petito and Laundrie had fallen overboard from a boat, according to Florida State police. Petito was pronounced dead at a hospital the next day. But what was the cause of Laundrie's death, and what led to his death along with Petito? Legal experts have argued that the laws surrounding homicide in Florida are vague—which is why it is difficult to determine who is responsible for the death of the couple. One of the most troubling questions surrounding Petito's homicide is the role of third parties, including family and friends. Laundrie is the second murder victim to be identified in the case. The first was David Rosen, who worked as an assistant to the sheriff's office in Florida. Rosen's parents were able to identify his body in June 2020 and have since filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the sheriff's office. But the case against sheriff's officials is still pending. Some legal experts believe that the couple may have been involved in an intimate relationship, but it is unclear if it was consensual or not. In a short statement sent out by the sheriff's office, a spokesman said that Laundrie and Petito had been \"friends\" for several months. While authorities are still investigating the cause of Laundrie's death, many questions remain unanswered regarding Petito's homicide. Here is a summary: An investigation into the murder of Gabby Petito in Florida has uncovered the remains of a man who died along with her in a boat on July 2, 2019. Authorities are still unsure of the cause of his death, but some legal experts believe it may have been in addition to her drowning, according to NBC News. The man was found in Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in Ocala, Florida, the weekend after Petito died. The sheriff's office said the couple had fallen overboard from a boat and Petito was pronounced dead the next day. Brian Laundrie's death will no doubt be a major factor in the upcoming trial of petty officer Darren Wilson, the police officer who fired seven shots at 23-year-old Petito in April 2018. The trial is set to begin in August."}

As the case of Gabby Petito became a matter of national news, the focus on her race became especially prevalent. Journalists and public figures from across the ideological spectrum criticized media attention to her case, pointing out that it's a symptom of a longstanding problem in media storytelling. Why focus on her race, and how can race be a factor when reporting? Media coverage of missing women has focused on race disproportionately over the years, according to Chris Cuomo, who has been covering the case of missing woman, Gabby Petito, for the past three months. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nGabby Petito, 23, from Idaho, went missing on August 3, 2017. She has been missing for almost five months. Her disappearance has been covered extensively in the media and has led to widespread public concern about her safety.\n\nThe case of Petito, whose disappearance sparked nationwide debate on the issue of missing white women, has received intense media coverage since her disappearance. The story has been reported by multiple outlets, including CNN, the Washington Post, Fox News, and the BBC. A number of politicians from both sides of the political spectrum have also shared their views on the case and have been critical of media coverage of Petito's disappearance.\n\nIn fact, the hashtag #missingwhitewomensyndrome has been trending on Twitter since Gabby Petito's disappearance, with millions of people sharing their opinions on the issue. The hashtag was started by the author and activist Lauren Berard in June of this year. As the name suggests, the hashtag highlights media's disproportionate focus on white female victims, neglecting victims of color.\n\nThe hashtag trending on Twitter has been criticized by journalists and public figures from across the ideological spectrum. Others have argued that the hashtag is actually a symptom of a larger problem in media coverage of missing women. According to a CNN article written by Lauren Berard and published last month, the term 'missing white woman syndrome' was coined by a woman who worked as a magazine editor when she was a teenager. She felt that media coverage of missing women was skewed by a focus on white women of a similar age to her, and often neglected cases of women of color.\n\nThe article explains that although the hashtag was coined by a teenager, the term was popularized by a news reporter. She used the term to explain how the news media's focus on missing women was a symptom of a larger problem in media coverage of missing women."}
