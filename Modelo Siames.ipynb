       "      <td>Biden takes the helm, appeals for unity to take on crises\\n\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, declaring that \"democracy has prevailed\" and summoning American resilience and unity to confront the deeply divided nation's historic confluence of crises.\\n\\nDenouncing a national \"uncivil war,\" Biden took the oath at a U.S. Capitol that had been battered by an insurrectionist siege just two weeks earlier. Then, taking his place in the White House Oval Office, he plunged into a stack of executive actions that began to undo the heart of his polarizing predecessor 's agenda on matters from the deadly pandemic to climate change.\\n\\nAt the Capitol, with America's tradition of peaceful transfers of power never appearing more fragile, the ceremony unfolded within a circle of security forces evocative of a war zone and devoid of crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nInstead, Biden gazed out on a cold Washington morning dotted with snow flurries to see over 200,000 American flags planted on the National Mall to symbolize those who could not attend in person.\\n\\n\"The will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious and democracy is fragile. At this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,\" Biden declared in his speech. \"This is America's day. This is democracy's day. A day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve.\"\\n\\nHistory was made at his side, as Kamala Harris became the first woman to be vice president. The former U.S. senator from California is also the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency and the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in the U.S. government.\\n\\nBiden never mentioned his predecessor, who defied tradition and left town ahead of the ceremony, but his speech was an implicit rebuke of Donald Trump. The new president denounced \"lies told for power and for profit\" and was blunt about the challenges ahead.\\n\\nCentral among them: the surging virus that has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the United States, as well as economic strains and a national reckoning over race.\\n\\n\"We have much to do in this winter of peril, and significant possibilities. Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build and much to gain,\" Biden said. \"Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged, or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now.\"\\n\\nBiden was eager to go big early, with an ambitious first 100 days including a push to speed up the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations to anxious Americans and pass a $1.9 trillion economic relief package. It included a blitz of executive orders on matters that don't require congressional approval — a mix of substantive and symbolic steps to unwind the Trump years. His actions included re-entry into the Paris Climate Accords and a mandate for wearing masks on federal property.\\n\\n\"There's no time to start like today,\" a masked Biden said. in the Oval Office. Then he swore in hundreds of aides — virtually — telling them, \"You're my possibilities.\"\\n\\nThe absence of Biden's predecessor from the inaugural ceremony underscored the national rift to be healed.\\n\\nBut a bipartisan trio of former presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama — were there to witness the transfer of power. Trump, awaiting his second impeachment trial, was at his Florida resort by the time the swearing-in took place.</td>\n",

An autopsy is being conducted.\\n\\nBrian Laundrie remains missing. A search for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve in Florida has been suspended.\\n\\nUWO student Miranda Baker took to TikTok to say she and her boyfriend picked up a hitchhiker at Grand Teton National Park on August 29. She says that hitchhiker was Brian Laundrie. They called authorities.\\n\\n\"He got out and he was thankful and he was kind of in a hurry. So he said he was going to go across the street into the parking lot and find someone else to give him a ride. But when we looked back 10 or 15 seconds after he got out of the vehicle, he was gone,\" Baker told Good Morning America.\\n\\nThe case has been the source of nationwide intrigue. Laundrie and Petito were on a cross-country van trip and detailing their journey on social media prior to Petito's disappearance. Petito's family last heard from the 22-year-old on Aug. 25. That's when the last photos of the couple together were posted on social media. They were camping at Grand Teton.\\n\\nIt was Aug. 29 when Miranda Baker and her boyfriend picked up the hitchhiker who they say was Laundrie.\\n\\n\"On Aug. 29, my boyfriend and I picked up Brian at Grand Teton National Park at 5:30 at night at Colter Bay. I'm hoping this can help someone identify him because I saw him from TikTok, which made me call the authorities and my boyfriend and I have been in contact with a bunch of different people to help piece together different parts of this case,\" Baker says in a TikTok posted three days ago.\\n\\n\"He approached us asking us for a ride because he needed to go to Jackson, which we were going to Jackson that night. I said hop in. He hops in the back of my Jeep. We then proceeded to make small talk. Before he came into the car he offered to pay us like, $200 to give him a ride, like 10 miles. So that was kind of weird. He then told us he's been camping for multiple days without his fiancée. He did say he had a fiancée, and that she was working on their social media page back at their van. In conversation, I brought up that we're going to Jackson. He freaked out. He's like 'nope, I need to get out right now, you know, pull over.' So we pulled over at the Jackson Dam. It's not very far from Colter Bay.\"\\n\\nBaker said Laundrie \"had scruff, but didn't look dirty.\" She found that strange because he said he had been camping.\\n\\nShe says they dropped Laundrie off at 6:09 p.m. on Aug. 29. He told them he was going to find someone else to hitch a ride.\\n\\nBaker did another video mapping out the area where they picked up Laundrie.\\n\\nSeveral days later, on Sept. 1, Laundrie returned home to North Port, Florida. He and Gabby lived with his parents there.\\n\\nOn Sept. 11, Petito's family reported her missing. Laundrie chose not to cooperate with authorities.\\n\\nOn Sept. 17, police and the FBI announce that Laundrie is missing and his family saw him three days prior to that date.\\n\\nOn Sept. 19, searchers find the body of a woman in northern Wyoming.

Biden, Jr.\\n\\nChief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans.\\n\\nThis is America's day.\\n\\nThis is democracy's day.\\n\\nA day of history and hope.\\n\\nOf renewal and resolve.\\n\\nThrough a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge.\\n\\nToday, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy.\\n\\nThe will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.\\n\\nWe have learned again that democracy is precious.\\n\\nDemocracy is fragile.\\n\\nAnd at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\\n\\nSo now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.\\n\\nWe look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.\\n\\nI thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here.\\n\\nI thank them from the bottom of my heart.\\n\\nYou know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation.\\n\\nAs does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.\\n\\nI have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took — an oath first sworn by George Washington.\\n\\nBut the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.\\n\\nOn \"We the People\" who seek a more perfect Union.\\n\\nThis is a great nation and we are a good people.\\n\\nOver the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go.\\n\\nWe will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.\\n\\nMuch to repair.\\n\\nMuch to restore.\\n\\nMuch to heal.\\n\\nMuch to build.\\n\\nAnd much to gain.\\n\\nFew periods in our nation's history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we're in now.\\n\\nA once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country.\\n\\nIt's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.\\n\\nMillions of jobs have been lost.\\n\\nHundreds of thousands of businesses closed.\\n\\nA cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\\n\\nA cry for survival comes from the planet itself.

Then, taking his place in the White House Oval Office, he plunged into a stack of executive actions that began to undo the heart of his polarizing predecessor 's agenda on matters from the deadly pandemic to climate change.\\n\\nAt the Capitol, with America's tradition of peaceful transfers of power never appearing more fragile, the ceremony unfolded within a circle of security forces evocative of a war zone and devoid of crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nInstead, Biden gazed out on a cold Washington morning dotted with snow flurries to see over 200,000 American flags planted on the National Mall to symbolize those who could not attend in person.\\n\\n\"The will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious and democracy is fragile. At this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,\" Biden declared in his speech. \"This is America's day. This is democracy's day. A day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve.\"\\n\\nHistory was made at his side, as Kamala Harris became the first woman to be vice president. The former U.S. senator from California is also the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency and the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in the U.S. government.\\n\\nBiden never mentioned his predecessor, who defied tradition and left town ahead of the ceremony, but his speech was an implicit rebuke of Donald Trump. The new president denounced \"lies told for power and for profit\" and was blunt about the challenges ahead.\\n\\nCentral among them: the surging virus that has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the United States, as well as economic strains and a national reckoning over race.\\n\\n\"We have much to do in this winter of peril, and significant possibilities. Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build and much to gain,\" Biden said. \"Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged, or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now.\"\\n\\nBiden was eager to go big early, with an ambitious first 100 days including a push to speed up the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations to anxious Americans and pass a $1.9 trillion economic relief package. It included a blitz of executive orders on matters that don't require congressional approval — a mix of substantive and symbolic steps to unwind the Trump years. His actions included re-entry into the Paris Climate Accords and a mandate for wearing masks on federal property.\\n\\n\"There's no time to start like today,\" a masked Biden said. in the Oval Office. Then he swore in hundreds of aides — virtually — telling them, \"You're my possibilities.\"\\n\\nThe absence of Biden's predecessor from the inaugural ceremony underscored the national rift to be healed.\\n\\nBut a bipartisan trio of former presidents — Bill Clinton, George W.

This was her dream,\" Schmidt said.\\n\\nPetito's parents said the couple documented every step of the way, spending time in Colorado and southern Utah.\\n\\n\"If you look at her Instagram page, you can actually find a lot of evidence of where they were these past few months,\" said Schmidt.\\n\\nSchmidt pointed to her daughter's Instagram account with posts at Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, and Mystic Hot Springs in Monroe\\n\\nBut toward the end of August, the posts started slowing down.\\n\\nPetito's father, who lives in Florida, said the couple was in Salt Lake City on Aug. 21. He knows because he placed an Uber Eats order for them.\\n\\n\"There was a power outage. She said she didn't have WiFi, so I ordered her some food,\" Joseph Petito said. \"I know it was in Salt Lake City. It was the last time I spoke to her.\"\\n\\nHe said the couple didn't have friends in Salt Lake City but wanted to spend time in the area.\\n\\nGabby Petito's parents said the couple left Salt Lake City for Grand Teton National Park around Aug. 24, where they believe the couple spent no more than two days.\\n\\nThis was also around the last time Petito spoke with her mother over FaceTime.\\n\\n\"She seemed OK to me at the time, other than I don't know where the relationship was going with the boyfriend,\" said Schmidt of the couple possibly going through a rough patch.\\n\\nThen the details get hazy as Petito's parents say they're not sure if she made it to her next destination.\\n\\n\"She was making her way up to Yellowstone,\" Schmidt said explaining that after Aug. 24 her communication with Petito grew sporadic and happened only via text.\\n\\n\"The last text I got from her was on Aug. 30. I don't know if that was her texting me or not,\" Schmidt said.\\n\\nThen Petito stopped responding all together. Schmidt said she initially figured the couple had lost internet reception but late last week, her mother knew something was off.\\n\\nPetito's parents said they started reaching out to their local law enforcement agencies in Florida and New York. On Saturday evening, Schmidt said a detective at the Suffolk County Police Department agreed to file a case.\\n\\nIn an email, the Suffolk County Police Department confirmed the van was located but did not specify where. In a press release, the van was described as a white 2012 Ford Transit van with Florida license plate QFTG03.\\n\\nThey also declined to provide information on Petito's boyfriend or his current whereabouts.\\n\\nA department spokesperson also said the department does not comment on suspects or persons of interest adding, \"We are not commenting on who has been spoken to in relation to this investigation.\"\\n\\nAnyone with information is asked to call Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS, or they can submit an online tip through P3tips.com.\\n\\nPetito was described as approximately 5-foot-5, weighing 110 pounds.

An autopsy is being conducted.\\n\\nBrian Laundrie remains missing. A search for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve in Florida has been suspended.\\n\\nUWO student Miranda Baker took to TikTok to say she and her boyfriend picked up a hitchhiker at Grand Teton National Park on August 29. She says that hitchhiker was Brian Laundrie. They called authorities.\\n\\n\"He got out and he was thankful and he was kind of in a hurry. So he said he was going to go across the street into the parking lot and find someone else to give him a ride. But when we looked back 10 or 15 seconds after he got out of the vehicle, he was gone,\" Baker told Good Morning America.\\n\\nThe case has been the source of nationwide intrigue. Laundrie and Petito were on a cross-country van trip and detailing their journey on social media prior to Petito's disappearance. Petito's family last heard from the 22-year-old on Aug. 25. That's when the last photos of the couple together were posted on social media. They were camping at Grand Teton.\\n\\nIt was Aug. 29 when Miranda Baker and her boyfriend picked up the hitchhiker who they say was Laundrie.\\n\\n\"On Aug. 29, my boyfriend and I picked up Brian at Grand Teton National Park at 5:30 at night at Colter Bay. I'm hoping this can help someone identify him because I saw him from TikTok, which made me call the authorities and my boyfriend and I have been in contact with a bunch of different people to help piece together different parts of this case,\" Baker says in a TikTok posted three days ago.\\n\\n\"He approached us asking us for a ride because he needed to go to Jackson, which we were going to Jackson that night. I said hop in. He hops in the back of my Jeep. We then proceeded to make small talk. Before he came into the car he offered to pay us like, $200 to give him a ride, like 10 miles. So that was kind of weird. He then told us he's been camping for multiple days without his fiancée. He did say he had a fiancée, and that she was working on their social media page back at their van. In conversation, I brought up that we're going to Jackson. He freaked out. He's like 'nope, I need to get out right now, you know, pull over.' So we pulled over at the Jackson Dam. It's not very far from Colter Bay.\"\\n\\nBaker said Laundrie \"had scruff, but didn't look dirty.\" She found that strange because he said he had been camping.\\n\\nShe says they dropped Laundrie off at 6:09 p.m. on Aug. 29. He told them he was going to find someone else to hitch a ride.\\n\\nBaker did another video mapping out the area where they picked up Laundrie.\\n\\nSeveral days later, on Sept. 1, Laundrie returned home to North Port, Florida. He and Gabby lived with his parents there.\\n\\nOn Sept. 11, Petito's family reported her missing. Laundrie chose not to cooperate with authorities.\\n\\nOn Sept. 17, police and the FBI announce that Laundrie is missing and his family saw him three days prior to that date.\\n\\nOn Sept. 19, searchers find the body of a woman in northern Wyoming. They believe it to be Gabby Petito.\\n\\nBrian Laundrie has been called a person of interest in the case.   \n",

An autopsy is being conducted.\\n\\nBrian Laundrie remains missing. A search for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve in Florida has been suspended.\\n\\nUWO student Miranda Baker took to TikTok to say she and her boyfriend picked up a hitchhiker at Grand Teton National Park on August 29. She says that hitchhiker was Brian Laundrie. They called authorities.\\n\\n\"He got out and he was thankful and he was kind of in a hurry. So he said he was going to go across the street into the parking lot and find someone else to give him a ride. But when we looked back 10 or 15 seconds after he got out of the vehicle, he was gone,\" Baker told Good Morning America.\\n\\nThe case has been the source of nationwide intrigue. Laundrie and Petito were on a cross-country van trip and detailing their journey on social media prior to Petito's disappearance. Petito's family last heard from the 22-year-old on Aug. 25. That's when the last photos of the couple together were posted on social media. They were camping at Grand Teton.\\n\\nIt was Aug. 29 when Miranda Baker and her boyfriend picked up the hitchhiker who they say was Laundrie.\\n\\n\"On Aug. 29, my boyfriend and I picked up Brian at Grand Teton National Park at 5:30 at night at Colter Bay. I'm hoping this can help someone identify him because I saw him from TikTok, which made me call the authorities and my boyfriend and I have been in contact with a bunch of different people to help piece together different parts of this case,\" Baker says in a TikTok posted three days ago.\\n\\n\"He approached us asking us for a ride because he needed to go to Jackson, which we were going to Jackson that night. I said hop in. He hops in the back of my Jeep. We then proceeded to make small talk. Before he came into the car he offered to pay us like, $200 to give him a ride, like 10 miles. So that was kind of weird. He then told us he's been camping for multiple days without his fiancée. He did say he had a fiancée, and that she was working on their social media page back at their van. In conversation, I brought up that we're going to Jackson. He freaked out. He's like 'nope, I need to get out right now, you know, pull over.' So we pulled over at the Jackson Dam. It's not very far from Colter Bay.\"\\n\\nBaker said Laundrie \"had scruff, but didn't look dirty.\" She found that strange because he said he had been camping.\\n\\nShe says they dropped Laundrie off at 6:09 p.m. on Aug. 29. He told them he was going to find someone else to hitch a ride.\\n\\nBaker did another video mapping out the area where they picked up Laundrie.\\n\\nSeveral days later, on Sept. 1, Laundrie returned home to North Port, Florida. He and Gabby lived with his parents there.\\n\\nOn Sept. 11, Petito's family reported her missing. Laundrie chose not to cooperate with authorities.\\n\\nOn Sept. 17, police and the FBI announce that Laundrie is missing and his family saw him three days prior to that date.\\n\\nOn Sept. 19, searchers find the body of a woman in northern Wyoming.

The poem addresses themes of hope, unity, and resilience in the face of adversity. Gorman's poem reflects on the challenges the United States has faced and envisions a future of improvement and inclusivity.

This was her dream,\" Schmidt said.\\n\\nPetito's parents said the couple documented every step of the way, spending time in Colorado and southern Utah.\\n\\n\"If you look at her Instagram page, you can actually find a lot of evidence of where they were these past few months,\" said Schmidt.\\n\\nSchmidt pointed to her daughter's Instagram account with posts at Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, and Mystic Hot Springs in Monroe\\n\\nBut toward the end of August, the posts started slowing down.\\n\\nPetito's father, who lives in Florida, said the couple was in Salt Lake City on Aug. 21. He knows because he placed an Uber Eats order for them.\\n\\n\"There was a power outage. She said she didn't have WiFi, so I ordered her some food,\" Joseph Petito said. \"I know it was in Salt Lake City.

On Saturday evening, Schmidt said a detective at the Suffolk County Police Department agreed to file a case.\\n\\nIn an email, the Suffolk County Police Department confirmed the van was located but did not specify where. In a press release, the van was described as a white 2012 Ford Transit van with Florida license plate QFTG03.\\n\\nThey also declined to provide information on Petito's boyfriend or his current whereabouts.\\n\\nA department spokesperson also said the department does not comment on suspects or persons of interest adding, \"We are not commenting on who has been spoken to in relation to this investigation.\"\\n\\nAnyone with information is asked to call Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS, or they can submit an online tip through P3tips.com.\\n\\nPetito was described as approximately 5-foot-5, weighing 110 pounds.

An autopsy is being conducted.\\n\\nBrian Laundrie remains missing. A search for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve in Florida has been suspended.\\n\\nUWO student Miranda Baker took to TikTok to say she and her boyfriend picked up a hitchhiker at Grand Teton National Park on August 29. She says that hitchhiker was Brian Laundrie. They called authorities.\\n\\n\"He got out and he was thankful and he was kind of in a hurry. So he said he was going to go across the street into the parking lot and find someone else to give him a ride. But when we looked back 10 or 15 seconds after he got out of the vehicle, he was gone,\" Baker told Good Morning America.\\n\\nThe case has been the source of nationwide intrigue. Laundrie and Petito were on a cross-country van trip and detailing their journey on social media prior to Petito's disappearance. Petito's family last heard from the 22-year-old on Aug. 25. That's when the last photos of the couple together were posted on social media. They were camping at Grand Teton.\\n\\nIt was Aug. 29 when Miranda Baker and her boyfriend picked up the hitchhiker who they say was Laundrie.\\n\\n\"On Aug. 29, my boyfriend and I picked up Brian at Grand Teton National Park at 5:30 at night at Colter Bay. I'm hoping this can help someone identify him because I saw him from TikTok, which made me call the authorities and my boyfriend and I have been in contact with a bunch of different people to help piece together different parts of this case,\" Baker says in a TikTok posted three days ago.\\n\\n\"He approached us asking us for a ride because he needed to go to Jackson, which we were going to Jackson that night. I said hop in. He hops in the back of my Jeep. We then proceeded to make small talk. Before he came into the car he offered to pay us like, $200 to give him a ride, like 10 miles. So that was kind of weird. He then told us he's been camping for multiple days without his fiancée. He did say he had a fiancée, and that she was working on their social media page back at their van. In conversation, I brought up that we're going to Jackson. He freaked out. He's like 'nope, I need to get out right now, you know, pull over.' So we pulled over at the Jackson Dam. It's not very far from Colter Bay.\"\\n\\nBaker said Laundrie \"had scruff, but didn't look dirty.\" She found that strange because he said he had been camping.\\n\\nShe says they dropped Laundrie off at 6:09 p.m. on Aug. 29. He told them he was going to find someone else to hitch a ride.\\n\\nBaker did another video mapping out the area where they picked up Laundrie.\\n\\nSeveral days later, on Sept. 1, Laundrie returned home to North Port, Florida. He and Gabby lived with his parents there.\\n\\nOn Sept. 11, Petito's family reported her missing. Laundrie chose not to cooperate with authorities.\\n\\nOn Sept. 17, police and the FBI announce that Laundrie is missing and his family saw him three days prior to that date.\\n\\nOn Sept. 19, searchers find the body of a woman in northern Wyoming. They believe it to be Gabby Petito.\\n\\nBrian Laundrie has been called a person of interest in the case.   \n",

She's never come into the store without a big smile on her face.\"\\n\\nPetito's remains were found Sunday in Wyoming's Teton-Bridger National Forest after she went missing while on a cross-country road trip with her fiance, Brian Laundrie, late last month.\\n\\nThe Teton County Coroner said that her death was a homicide on Tuesday and the cause of death will be determined after autopsy results, the FBI said.\\n\\nGABBY PETITO: BRIAN LAUNDRIE SEARCH RESUMING IN CARLTON RESERVE AS AUTOPSY DUE TUESDAY\\n\\nIn June, Petito and Laundrie set out on their trip in a 2012 white Ford camper van, first from Florida to New York and then out west to tour national parks.\\n\\nRight before leaving Long Island in early July, Petito stopped into the surf shop one last time.\\n\\n\"She's been coming in since she was 12, she used to come in all the time. We hadn't seen her in a little bit,\" the owner of the store said Tuesday. \"Before she went on the trip, she stopped in to buy her boyfriend a shirt.\"\\n\\nLaundrie returned to the Florida Gulf Coast town of North Port, where their trip began, on Sept. 1 without Petito but with her white van.\\n\\nThe van was seized from the Laundrie family's Florida home on Sept. 11 after her family officially reported her missing earlier that same day, and Laundrie was named a person of interest in her disappearance on Sept. 15.\\n\\nLaundrie disappeared himself on Sept. 14. A team of FBI agents then swarmed the family's house on Monday and authorities have been searching for him in a nearby nature reserve as well as other locations around Florida.\\n\\nOther friends and family of Petito echoed the surf shop owner's sentiments about her.\\n\\n\"She's so creative and artistic and talented and sweet,\" Nichole Schmidt, Petito's mother, told Fox News last week before her daughter's remains were found.\\n\\n\"She's a typical 22-year-old who just wants to live life, go on adventures, start a YouTube account and travel and teach other people how to do it.\"\\n\\nPetito's best friend in Florida said that she \"made a mark on anyone she came in contact with.\"\\n\\n\"Even [if] it was a quick interaction. She not only sees the light in everyone but spreads her light with everyone,\" the friend told Fox News. \"At my lowest, she managed to help me keep my chin up.\"   \n",
